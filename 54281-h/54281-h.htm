<h2>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/v-i-100.png" width="100" height="100" alt="I" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">I HAVE</span> edited, and illustrated "The Voiage
and Travayle of Syr John Maundeville,
Knight," for two reasons. First, that a
popular edition has not been published for
many years&mdash;so much so, that many otherwise well
educated people hardly know his name; or, if they do,
have never read his book of Marvels. Secondly, a good
edition has not yet been published. Putting aside the
chap-books of the eighteenth century, which could only
cram a small portion of his book into their little duodecimos,
the only English versions of this century are the
reprint by Halliwell, in 1839, of the <i>reprint</i> in 1725-1727,
of the early fifteenth century MS. (Cotton, Tit. c. 16),
which he again reprinted in 1866,<a id="footnotetagpre1" name="footnotetagpre1"></a><a href="#footnotepre1"><sup>1</sup></a> the edition in "Bohn's
Classical Library" ("Early Travels in Palestine"), 1848;
and "The English Explorers," which forms part of
Nimmo's "National Library," 1875. There was also a
small edition published in Cassell's "National Library"
in 1886 in modern English.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagevi" id="pagevi"></a>[pg vi]</span></p>

<p>Halliwell's reprint of the Cotton MS. is open to objection,
because the language of the MS. is specially rude,
and can only be understood by professed antiquaries, no
footnotes explanatory of the text being given, only a
glossary at the end of the book. Also, Mr. Halliwell
has taken his illustrations from various sources, not confining
himself to English woodcuts&mdash;the Cotton MS.
having no illustrations. If, however, the language in
Halliwell's edition is too archaic, Bohn and Nimmo err
in the opposite direction. Without illustrations, and
clothed in modern English, they are bald in the extreme;
whilst the editors of both have not been over careful to
closely copy the text.</p>

<p>Seeing these difficulties, and dearly loving Sir John,
in spite of his romancing, I cast about for a book which
should fulfil the conditions of an edition I should like
for my own reading; which should have the spice of the
old language, without being unreadable, like the Cotton
MS., and which contained the original quaint illustrations.
This I have found in a reprint of Pynson's unique edition
(now in the Grenville Library, British Museum), from
which it varies very slightly, except in the modernizing
of the language, which is rather an advantage; and
which, by means of the copious footnotes I have made,
will, I hope, be easily read by anybody.</p>

<p>This edition, too, was particularly rich in woodcuts,
which I have faithfully facsimiled; and, in the Appendix,
I have reproduced a few from other editions, showing
the different treatment of some subjects. In the Appendix,
also, I have given a list of all the editions of Sir
John Mandeville's Travels now in the British Museum.
A glance at this will show how popular his book
was, in all civilized countries, and in all ages, since
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagevii" id="pagevii"></a>[pg vii]</span>
its first publication.<a id="footnotetagpre2" name="footnotetagpre2"></a><a href="#footnotepre2"><sup>2</sup></a> I have thought that an edition
should be produced which could be read by all, and
therefore have given explanations of words and facts,
perfectly familiar to advanced students, by means of
which they will not be inconvenienced, and the general
reader much benefited.</p>

<p>Perhaps the Illustrations in one or two of the early
foreign editions are quainter, but I wanted, and have
got, a thoroughly representative <i>English</i> Edition, which
gives Sir John's adventures, with their concomitant
"Travellers' Tales," without the apocryphal stories
which were introduced into some of the MSS. and
foreign editions.</p>

<p>Of East, the printer of the exemplar I have chosen,
very little is known; and, curiously, he is ignored in Herbert
and Dibdin's edition of <i>Ames' Typographical Antiquities</i>.
According to Ames, he was made free of the
Stationers' Company 3rd December, 1565, and he gives
his first known printed book as 1569, or a year later
than the book I have copied. East, according to the
same authority, was granted a patent for ruled paper
for music, and worked both for Bird and Tallis. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageviii" id="pageviii"></a>[pg viii]</span>
date of his death does not seem to be known, but his
widow, or daughter, printed a book of Bird's music
in 1610.</p>

Colonel Yule, in "The Book of Ser Marco Polo," &amp;c. (1871), says:&mdash;"And
from the great frequency with which one encounters in catalogues
both MSS. and early printed editions of Sir John Maundeville,
I should suppose that the lying wonders of our English
knight had a far greater popularity and more extensive diffusion
than the veracious and more sober marvels of Polo. In Quaritch's
last catalogue (November, 1870) there is only one <i>old</i> edition of
Polo; there are nine of Maundeville. In 1839 there were nineteen
MSS. of the latter <i>catalogued</i> in the British Museum Library.
There are <i>now</i> only five of Marco Polo. At least twenty-five
editions of Maundeville, and only five of Polo were printed in the
fifteenth century."</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">I KNOW</span> of nothing more likely to be provocative
of a literary war than the question
of Sir John Mandeville's personal entity.
Were I to express an opinion either way&mdash;that
he was a real being, or that he never existed&mdash;fierce
would be the criticism on my views, and much
good ink be spilt, which might well be devoted to a
better purpose, so that I prefer letting the reader form
his own opinion thereon,&mdash;a course which will save everybody
any trouble or vexation of spirit.</p>

<p>We labour under this difficulty&mdash;all that is known
about him is what he tells us himself, and no one who
reads the book can altogether trust his absolute verity.
If his book is a mere compilation from other sources, so
then is that of Odorico (who died January, 1331), which
I place in an Appendix, and which agrees with Mandeville
in so many particulars, that one might reasonably
suppose him to be the "fellawe," or companion, whom
he frequently mentions, and connect him with that
Minorite friar from Lombardy (for Odorico was born
at Udine or Friuli) who shrove them before their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagex" id="pagex"></a>[pg x]</span>
entrance into "y<sup>e</sup> Valey of Divels."<a id="footnotetagint1" name="footnotetagint1"></a><a href="#footnoteint1"><sup>1</sup></a> According to
his own account, he was a knight, that he was born at
St. Albans, and that he left England on his wonderful
voyage on 29th September, 1322. He informs us that
he travelled through Asia Minor, Armenia, Tartary,
Persia, Syria, Arabia, Upper and Lower Egypt, Libya,
Chald&aelig;a, a large portion of Ethiopia, Amazonia, Lower
India, and the greater part of Upper India, together
with the neighbouring islands. If his narrative can be
trusted, he lived in most friendly relations with the ruler
of Egypt, whom he served in his war against the
Bedouins, and was on such familiar terms that they
would privately argue on religious topics, and he was
even offered a richly dowered princess as a wife, if he
would but change his creed, and become a Mahometan.
If he can be believed, he wandered all over the then
known world, and gratified his military instincts by
helping the Emperor of China in his war against the
sovereign of Manzi. He tells us that after thirty-four
years of wandering and exile he returned to England,
taking Rome in his way home, in order to get the Pope's
Imprimatur to his book, for which he na&iuml;vely gives as
reason: "and, for as much as many men beleve not that
they see with theyr eyen, or y<sup>t</sup> they may conceiue &amp;
know in their mynde, therefore I made my way to Rome
in my coming homewarde, to shew my boke to the holy
father the pope, and tell him of the mervayles y<sup>t</sup> I had
sene in diverse countreys; so that he with his wise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexi" id="pagexi"></a>[pg xi]</span>
counsel wold examine it, with diverse folke y<sup>t</sup> are at
Rome, for there dwell men of all nations of the world,
and a lytle time after whan he &amp; his co&#361;sel had examined
it all through, he sayde to me for a certayne that it was
true, for he sayd he had a boke of latin contayning all
that, and much more, of y<sup>e</sup> which <i>Mappa Mundi</i> is
made, the which boke I saw, &amp; therefore the pope hath
ratyfied &amp; confirmed my boke in all poyntes." If any
portion of this is true, it is probable that the "boke of
latin" may have been Pliny, Solinus, or some other
equally veracious writer.</p>

<p>As to the "Mappa Mundi" constructed from such
sources, that at Hereford may be taken as a type of
ideal geography of the time. This was almost contemporary
with Mandeville, and is ascribed to the very early
part of the fourteenth century. Indeed, it can be proved
to be of this date, for, among other inscriptions on the
map, is the following:-</p>

<div class="poem width21">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Tuz Ki cest estoire ont.</p>
<p>Ou oyront ou lirront ou veront.</p>
<p>Prieut a ihesu su deyte.</p>
<p>De Richard de Haldingdam e de Lafford eyt pite.</p>
<p>Ki lat fet e compasse.</p>
<p>Ki ioie eu cel li seit donc."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Which may be thus translated:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"All who have, or shall have, or shall read, or shall see this history&mdash;pray
to Jesu in deity (or as God) that he may have pity on
Richard of Haldingham and of Lafford, who has made and contrived
it, that joy in heaven may be given unto him."
</p></blockquote>

<p>Richard of Haldingham, or Holdingham, whose real
name was Richard de la Battayle, or de Bello,<a id="footnotetagint2" name="footnotetagint2"></a><a href="#footnoteint2"><sup>2</sup></a> held the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexii" id="pagexii"></a>[pg xii]</span>
prebend of Lafford (now Sleaford), in Lincoln Cathedral
up to the year 1283, and afterwards held the prebend
of Norton, in Hereford Cathedral. Hardy, in his
edition of Le Neve's <i>Fasti Ecclesi&aelig; Anglican&aelig;</i>, says he
was appointed to this stall in 1305. He was afterwards
preferred to the Archidiaconate of Berkshire. Perhaps
the best description of this map is in a paper read before
the Geographical Society of Paris, 30th November, 1861,
by M. D'Avezac, President of the Society, a translation
of which may be found in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> of
May, 1863. He considers it to have been executed early
in the year 1314, because Lyons was not annexed to
France till the 30th of April, 1313, and gives other
reasons, equally strong, in support of his argument.</p>

<p>Thus, then, we have a contemporary map as a guide,
and on this Hereford map are portrayed all the monsters
described by Mandeville&mdash;the one-eyed men, those with
their heads in their breasts, even the big-footed one-legged
man&mdash;all those things which are regarded as
fable in Mandeville&mdash;are here drawn, and evidently must
have been currently believed in. So that when Mandeville,
or some subsequent editor, challenged the <i>Mappa
Mundi</i> as confirmatory evidence, he clearly knew what
he was about.</p>

<p>A strong presumption of his personal being is drawn
from the fact that Li&egrave;ge is said to be the place of his
burial, <i>see Appendix Harl.</i>, 3589. 2, "qui obiit Leodii
<span class="sc">a.d.</span> 1382." That he was believed to have lived at Li&egrave;ge
is also shown in <i>Appendix Grenville</i>, 6728/3, where he is
said to have written his book in the year 1355; and if
Weever<a id="footnotetagint3" name="footnotetagint3"></a><a href="#footnoteint3"><sup>3</sup></a> is to believed, he died there, but at an earlier
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexiii" id="pagexiii"></a>[pg xiii]</span>
date, namely, 1371. Speaking of St. Albans, he says:
"This Towne vaunts her selfe very much of the birth
and buriall of <i>Sir Iohn Mandeuill</i> Knight, the famous
Trauailer, who writ in Latine, French, and in the English
tongue, his Itinerary of three and thirty yeares. And
that you may beleeue the report of the Inhabitants to
bee true, they haue lately pensild a rare piece of Poetry,
or an Epitaph for him, vpon a piller; neere to which,
they suppose his body to haue beene buried, which I
think not much amisse to set downe; for although it
will not bee worth the reading, yet do but set it to some
lofty tune, as to the <i>Hunting of Antichrist</i>, or the leke,
I know it will be well worth the singing: marke how it
runs.</p>

<p>"The Churchmen will shew you here his kniues, the
furniture of his horse, and his spurres, which he vsed in

<p>Thus speaks Weever, and nobody doubts but that
there was a tomb of a Jehan de Maundeville in the Abbey
of the Guilelmites,<a id="footnotetagint5" name="footnotetagint5"></a><a href="#footnoteint5"><sup>5</sup></a> which is mentioned by Bollandus in his
<i>Acta Sanctorum</i> (Februarius, Tom. 2, p. 481, edit. 1658)
as "Domus de Motta extra Leodium, inchoata, anno
CI<span style="font-size: 1.05em">&#8579;</span>CCLXXXI." The abbey, or hospital, is now destroyed;
but, as side proofs, let me give two extracts
from different works of the eighteenth century. One,
"Abr&eacute;g&eacute; curieux et nouveau de l'histoire de Liege," &amp;c.
(no date), 24mo., p. 117. "L'H&ocirc;pital &amp; la Chapelle de
S. Guilleaume aux Faux-bourgs de S. Walburge furent
fondez l'an 1330," and in "Abr&eacute;g&eacute; Chronologique de
l'histoire de Liege, jusqu'a l'ann&eacute;e 1784, &amp;c." Liege,
1784, 12mo., p. 66. It says, "L'h&ocirc;pital &amp; la chapelle de
Saint Guillaume au fauxbourg de Sainte Walburge furent
fond&eacute;s l'an 1330."</p>

<p>As I said before, regarding Mandeville it must be a
question of faith. If Weever is to be relied on, he was a
physician, and from the fact of his wearing a beard, probably
acquired in his eastern travels, he received the
sobriquet of "ad Barbam." This title, however, is
claimed for a certain "Jehan de Bourgoigne dit &agrave; la
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexvi" id="pagexvi"></a>[pg xvi]</span>
Barbe," but the bare fact of anyone wearing a beard in
France, in the clean-shaven fourteenth century, was
sufficient to make him remarkable.</p>

<p>If, again, Weever and others are to be relied on, he
died in 1371, and it is a curious fact that the earliest
French, or Romance, manuscript known in this country is
one of that date, and, moreover, it is circumstantially
dated, as will be shown hereafter. This MS. is in the
Earl of Ashburnham's collection (catalogued Barrois 24),
which every lover of literature will regret was not secured
for the nation in its entirety. Its text is most beautiful,
and the few illuminations are fine examples of fourteenth
century French art. But what I want particularly to
point out, is the curious coincidence of dates&mdash;absolutely
contemporaneous. Whether there were any MSS. published
before then I cannot tell, but here is a book published
the year of his death, when inquiry would have
proved easily whether such a man had ever lived, but the
whole style of the MS. shows that he was well known as
a traveller, and it is evidently copied from an earlier
edition, as at the end it says, "Ce livre cy fist escrire
honorables homes sages et discret maistre Gervaise crestien,
maistre en medicine, et premier phisicien de tres
puissant noble et excellent prince Charles, par la Grace
de Dieu, roy de France, Escript par Raoulet dorliens lan
de grace mil ccclxxj le xviij jour de Septembre."</p>

<p>Here we have an authentic date, which there could be
no earthly reason to falsify, and this MS. was written&mdash;unless
Weever and others are liars&mdash;during the man's
lifetime. For, according to their authority, he did not
die until <i>November</i> of that year, and we must not fail to
remember that Liege was not a very far cry from Paris,
and that his fame must have been great, or his book
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexvii" id="pagexvii"></a>[pg xvii]</span>
would never have been written as a present for the king,
as it probably was.</p>

<p>This manuscript, being the earliest known, is also useful
in another way. By some singular chance, all the
English versions make out that Mandeville wrote his
book first in Latin, then in French, and afterwards in
English. But this manuscript settles the point, as it says,
"Et sachies q&#771; je eusse cest livret mis en latin pour plus
briefment deviser. Mais pour ce que pluseurs entendent
mieulx rom&#771;ant que latin je lay mis en rom&#771;ant par quoy
q&#771; chacun lentende." Which I translate: "And know
that I should (or might) have written this book in Latin,
for the sake of brevity. But, because more people know
the Romance (or French) tongue, than Latin, I have
written it in Romance, so that anyone may understand
it." And this translation is endorsed by E. M. Thompson,
Esq., the head of the MS. department in the British
Museum. It all depends on the words "je eusse." They
do not mean <i>I had</i>; and, even in modern French, might
be used for <i>I should have</i>, although of course <i>j'aurais</i>
would be better.</p>

<p>For many years he has been called the "father of
English Prose," but this title, after the above, is doubtful,
even if his existence is granted, and belongs of right
to Wyclif.</p>

<p>Another book, and a very rare and curious one it
is, is attributed to Mandeville. There is a copy of
this book in the British Museum (C. 27, f. 2), which,
although in Gothic letter, gives no clue as to its date,
or place of birth, nor do any of the bibliographical
authorities which I have consulted (and they are all
that can be found in the British Museum) throw any
light upon it. The museum authorities catalogue it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexviii" id="pagexviii"></a>[pg xviii]</span>
as <i>Lyons? 1530?</i> Its title is "<span class="sc">Le Lapidaire</span> <i>en francoys
compose par messire Jehan de mandeuille chevalier</i>."
Its contents are of little worth, except that they contain a
store of legendary lore relating to precious stones, such
as are met with in most medieval treatises on jewels and
it winds up with a prayer. The authorship of this book,
too, must be a matter of faith, since it has nothing to
guarantee it but its title-page.</p>

<p>It is somewhat singular too, that the Latin letter supposed
to be written by Mandeville to King Edward the
Third, and which is <i>apropos</i> of nothing, only exists in the
French edition.</p>

<p>In the appended Travels of Oderico, the Minorite
Friar, I have italicized many of the passages which are
identical with Mandeville's description in order that the
reader may have easier reference.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="footnote1"><a id="footnoteint1" name="footnoteint1"></a><a class="footnote" href="#footnotetagint1">1:</a>&nbsp;

him to take flesh and bloud of the Virgin Mary, &amp;
to environ that lande with his owne feete, and there
he wold do many myracles, preach and teach the fayth
and the law of Christen men, as unto his children, &amp;
there he would suffer many reprouves and scornes for us,
and he that was King of heaven and hell, of ayre, of sea,
of lande, and of all things that are contained in them,
wold alonely<a id="footnotetagvoy3" name="footnotetagvoy3"></a><a href="#footnotevoy3"><sup>3</sup></a> be called King of that land, when he sayde,
<i>Rex sum Judeorum</i>, I am King of Jewes: For that tyme
was that lande of Jewes, and that lande he chose before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2" id="page2"></a>[pg 2]</span>
all other landes, as the best &amp; most worthy of vertues
of all the world. And as the Philosopher sayth, <i>Virtus
rerum in medio consistit</i>. That is to say, the vertue of
things is in the midst: and in that lande he would leade
his lyfe, and suffer passion and death of the Jewes for
us, to save and deliver us from the paines of hell, and
from deathe without ende, the which was ordeyned to us
for the sinne of our father Adam, and our owne synnes
also, for as for himself he had none evil done ne<a id="footnotetagvoy4" name="footnotetagvoy4"></a><a href="#footnotevoy4"><sup>4</sup></a> deserved,
for he never thought ne dyd any evyll, for he that was
King of Glory and of joy might best in that place suffer
death. For he that will do any thinge that he will haue
knowen openly, he wyll proclayme it openly in the
myddle place of a towne or of a citie, so that it may bee
knowne to all parties of the citie, so he that was King of
glory and of all the worlde would suffer death for us at
Hierusalem, which is in the mydst of the worlde, so that
it might be knowen to all nations of the worlde how
deare he bought man, that he made with his handes in
his owne likenesse, for the great loue that he had to us.
Ah dere God, what love he had to his subjects, when he
that had done no trespasse, would for us trespassours
suffer death: for a more worthy catell<a id="footnotetagvoy5" name="footnotetagvoy5"></a><a href="#footnotevoy5"><sup>5</sup></a> he might not
have sette for us, then his owne blessed bodie and his
owne precious bloud the which he suffered for us: right
wel ought men to love, worship dreade, and serve such
a Lord, and prayse such an holy lande that brought
forth a lord of such fruite, through the which eche man
is saved but if it be his own defaute. This is that
lande prepared for an heritage to us, and in that lande
would he dye as seased,<a id="footnotetagvoy6" name="footnotetagvoy6"></a><a href="#footnotevoy6"><sup>6</sup></a> to leaue it to his children. For
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>[pg 3]</span>
the which eche good Chrysten man that may &amp; hath
wherewith, should strengthen him for to conquere our
righte heritage, and purchace<a id="footnotetagvoy7" name="footnotetagvoy7"></a><a href="#footnotevoy7"><sup>7</sup></a> out of the evill peoples
handes: for we are cleped<a id="footnotetagvoy8" name="footnotetagvoy8"></a><a href="#footnotevoy8"><sup>8</sup></a> christen men of Christ our
father, and if we be the ryght children of Christ, we
oughte to challenge the heritage that our father lefte us
&amp; take it out of straunge mens handes. But now
Pryde, Covetyse and Envy hath so inflamed the hearts
of the lordes of the worlde, that they are more busy for
to disheryte theyr neighbours than to challenge or conquere
their right heritage aforesayde. And the common
people that would put their bodies and theyr catell for
to conquere our heritage, they may not do so without
lordes: for assembling of the people without a chiefe
lorde, is as a flocke of sheepe without a sheepherd, the
which depart asunder, and wot not whether they shall go.
But would<a id="footnotetagvoy9" name="footnotetagvoy9"></a><a href="#footnotevoy9"><sup>9</sup></a> God, the worldly Lordes were at a good
accorde, and with other of their common people would
take this holy voyage over the sea. I trust well that
within a little tyme our right heritage before sayd should
be reconsiled and put into the hands of the right heires
of Jesu Christ. And for as much as it is long time that
there was any general passage over the sea, and that
many men desire to here speaking of the holy lande,
and have therefore great solace and comfort, therefore

<p>At Constantinople is the crosse of our Lord and his cote
without seame, the sponge and the rede with which the
Jewes gave our Lord gall to drinke on the Crosse, and
there is one of the nayles that our Lorde Jesu Christ
was nayled with to the Crosse. Some men think that
halfe the Crosse of Christ be in Cipres in an Abbey of
Monkes, that men call the hill of the holy crosse, but it
is not so, for the crosse that is in Cipres is the crosse on
which Dysmas<a id="footnotetagcpi23" name="footnotetagcpi23"></a><a href="#footnotecpi23"><sup>23</sup></a> the good theefe was hanged, but all men

wot<a id="footnotetagcpi24" name="footnotetagcpi24"></a><a href="#footnotecpi24"><sup>24</sup></a> not that, &amp; that is evil done but for the getting of
the offering they say that it is the crosse of our Lorde,
and ye shall understande that the crosse of our Lorde
Jesus Christ was made of foure maner of trees, as it is
conteyned in this verse following.</p>

<p class="title"><i>In cruce fit Palma, Cedrus, et Cypressus, Oliva.</i></p>

<p>For the piece that went ryght up from the earth unto
the head was of Cipres, and the piece that went overthwart,
to the which his handes were nayled, was of
Palme, and the stock that stood within the earth in the
which they had made a morteys, was of Cedre, and the
table aboue his head was a foote and a half long, on
which y<sup>e</sup> tytle was written, y<sup>t</sup> was of Olyve. Y<sup>e</sup> Jewes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg 10]</span>
made this crosse of these foure maner of trees for they
thought y<sup>t</sup> our Lord shold have hanged as long as y<sup>e</sup>
crosse might last, therefore they made the foote of
Cedre, for Ceder may not in the erth ne<a id="footnotetagcpi25" name="footnotetagcpi25"></a><a href="#footnotecpi25"><sup>25</sup></a> in water rot;
they thought that the body of Christ shold have stonken,
they made the piece y<sup>t</sup> went from the yearth upwarde of
Cipres so that the smell of his body shold greve no man
that came by, and that overthwart was made of Palme
in signification of Victory. And the table of the tytle
was made of Olive, for it betokeneth peace, as the story
of Noe witnesseth, when y<sup>e</sup> dove brought y<sup>e</sup> braunch of
Olive that betokened peace made between God and man.
And you also shal understande, that the Christen men
that dwell over the sea, say that the pece of the Crosse
that we call Cipres was of the tree that Adam eate the
appell of, and so finde they written, and they say also
that their scripture saith, that when Adam was sicke he
sayd to his son Seth that he shold go to Paradise and
pray that the Aungel that kepeth Paradise, y<sup>t</sup> he wold
send him oyle of the tree of mercy for to anoynte him
that he might have health, &amp; Seth went, but the
Aungel would not let him com in at the gate, but said
unto him that he might not have y<sup>e</sup> oyle of mercy, but
he took him three carnels<a id="footnotetagcpi26" name="footnotetagcpi26"></a><a href="#footnotecpi26"><sup>26</sup></a> of the same tree that his
father eate the appell of, and bad him as sone as his
father was dead, that he should put these carnels under
his tongue and bury him, and he did so, and of these
three carnels sprang a tree, as the Angel sayd and when
the tree bare fruite, then shold Adam be made whole.
And when Seth came againe and founde his father dead,
he did with the carnels as the Aungell commaunded him,
of the which came three trees, whereof a crosse was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[pg 11]</span>
made that bare good fruite, that is to say, our saviour
Jesu Christ, through whom Adam and all that came of
him should be saved and delivered from everlasting
death, but<a id="footnotetagcpi27" name="footnotetagcpi27"></a><a href="#footnotecpi27"><sup>27</sup></a>
if it be their owne defaute.<a id="footnotetagcpi28" name="footnotetagcpi28"></a><a href="#footnotecpi28"><sup>28</sup></a> This holy
crosse had the Jewes hid under the earth in y<sup>e</sup> rock of
the mount of Calvery, &amp; it laye there two hundreth
yeares and more, as they say, unto the tyme that Saint
Elene found it, the which Saint Elene was daughter of
Coel King of Englande, that then was called Britaine,
and after maried to Constantius, fyrst Consul and after
Emperour of Rome, who had by hir issue Constantine
the great, born in England and afterward Emperour of
Rome, which Constantine turned the name of Bezansium
into Constantinople, he reedified that citie, and made it
monarcall seate of all Europa and Asia Minor. Also
ye shall understande that the crosse of our Lord was in
length viii cubites and that the piece that went overthwart
was three cubites<a id="footnotetagcpi29" name="footnotetagcpi29"></a><a href="#footnotecpi29"><sup>29</sup></a> and a halfe.</p>

<a href="images/011-1000.png"><img src="images/011-500.png" width="500" height="352" alt="A part of the crowne of our Lord Jesu...." /></a></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg 12]</span></p>

<p>A part of the crowne of our Lord Jesu wherewith he
was crowned &amp; one of the nayles, and the speare head
and many other reliques are in France at Paris in the
chapell of the King, and the crowne lyeth in a vessell of
cristall wel dight and richly, for y<sup>e</sup> French King bought
these reliques sometime of the Jewes, to whome the
Emperour had laid them to pledge for a great sume of
golde. And although men say that this Crowne was of
thornes&mdash;ye shall understand that it was of Jonkes<a id="footnotetagcpi30" name="footnotetagcpi30"></a><a href="#footnotecpi30"><sup>30</sup></a> of
the sea, which be white and pricketh as sharp as thornes,
for I have seene and beheld many times that at Paris,
and that at Constantinople, for they were both of one,
and made of Jonkis of the sea. But men have departed
him in two partes, of the which one parte is at Paris, and
the other part at Constantinople, and I haue a point
thereof that seemeth a white thorne, and that was given
me for a great friendeship&mdash;for there are many of them
broken and fallen into the vessell, when they shew the
Crowne to great men or lordes that come theither. And
ye shall understande that our Lord in that night that he
was taken, he was led into a garden, and there he was
examined sharply, &amp; there the Jewes crowned him with
a crown of abbespine<a id="footnotetagcpi31" name="footnotetagcpi31"></a><a href="#footnotecpi31"><sup>31</sup></a> braunches that grew in the same
garden &amp; set it on his head so fast, that the blood came
downe by many places of his visage, necke, and shoulders,
and therefore hath the abbespine many vertues, for he that
beareth a braunche of it about him, no thunder, nor any
maner of tempest may hurt him, nor the house that it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg 13]</span>
in may no evill ghost come, nor in no place where it is.
And in that same garden Sainct Peter denied our Lord
thrise. And afterward was our Lord led before the Bishop
and ministers of the lawe into another gardein of Anne<a id="footnotetagcpi32" name="footnotetagcpi32"></a><a href="#footnotecpi32"><sup>32</sup></a>
and there was he examined, scorned &amp; crowned efte<a id="footnotetagcpi33" name="footnotetagcpi33"></a><a href="#footnotecpi33"><sup>33</sup></a> with
a swete thorn that men called barbareus<a id="footnotetagcpi34" name="footnotetagcpi34"></a><a href="#footnotecpi34"><sup>34</sup></a> that grew in
the same gardein and that hath many vertues. And
afterward he was led to a gardein of Caiphas, and there
he was crowned again with eglentine,<a id="footnotetagcpi35" name="footnotetagcpi35"></a><a href="#footnotecpi35"><sup>35</sup></a> and after that he
was led to a chamber of Pilate &amp; there he was crowned,
and the Jewes set him in a chaire and clad him in a mantell
of purpure<a id="footnotetagcpi36" name="footnotetagcpi36"></a><a href="#footnotecpi36"><sup>36</sup></a> and then made they a crowne of Jonkes of
the sea and there they kneled to him &amp; scorned him
saying <i>Ave rex Judeorum</i>. That is to say, haile King of
Jewes. And of this crowne, halfe is in Paris and the
other halfe at Constantinople, the which our Saviour
Jesu Christ hadde on his head, when he was nayled on
the crosse, and therefore shall men honour and worship
it, and holde it more worthy then any of the other. And
the speare shaft hath the Emperour of Almaine, but the
head which was put in his side is at Paris they say, in
the holy chappell, and oft tymes sayth the Emperour of
Constantinople, that he hath the speare head &amp; I have
often seen it, but it is greater than that at Paris. Also
at Constantinople lyeth Sainct Anne our ladie's mother,
whom Saint Elene caused to be brought from Hierusalem,
and there lieth also the body of Saint John
Chrisostome that was bishop of Constantinople. There
lyeth also sainct Luke the Evangelist, for his bones were
brought from Bethany where he was buried: and many
other relyques are there, and there is of the vessell of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg 14]</span>
stone as it were marble, which men call Idryus, that evermore
droppeth water &amp; fylleth himselfe every yeare once.
And ye shall wete that Constantinople is a fayre citie
and well walled &amp; it is three cornered, and there is an
arme of the sea that men call Hellespon, and some men
call it the bunch<a id="footnotetagcpi37" name="footnotetagcpi37"></a><a href="#footnotecpi37"><sup>37</sup></a> of Constantinople and some call it the
brace<a id="footnotetagcpi38" name="footnotetagcpi38"></a><a href="#footnotecpi38"><sup>38</sup></a> of sainct George, and this water encloseth two
partes of the citie, and upward to the sea upon that
water was wont to be the great citie of Troy in a fayre
plaine, but that citie was destroyed by the Grekes.</p>

The names of the penitent and impenitent thieves vary slightly
in different accounts. In the Apocryphal book of Nicodemus, cap.
7, vv. 10, 11, they are thus given: "But one of the two thieves
who were crucified with Jesus, whose name was Gestas, said to
Jesus, If thou art the Christ, deliver thyself and us. But the thief
who was crucified on his right hand, whose name was Dimas,
answering, rebuked him, and said, Dost thou not fear God, who art
condemned to this punishment? We indeed receive rightly and
justly the demerit of our actions: but this Jesus, what evil hath he
done?"</p>

<p class="footnote1c">But in the Apocryphal book, I. Infancy, cap. 8, vv. 1-7 (a
Nestorian and Gnostic book), the names are given differently: "In
their journey from hence they came into a desert country, and were
told it was infested with robbers; so Joseph and St. Mary prepared
to pass through it in the night.</p>

<p class="footnote1c">And, as they were going along, behold they saw two robbers
asleep in the road, and with them a great number of robbers, who
were their confederates, also asleep.</p>

<p class="footnote1c">The names of those two were Titus and Dumachus; and Titus
said to Dumachus, I beseech thee let those persons go along
quietly, that our company may not perceive any thing of them;</p>

<p class="footnote1c">But Dumachus refusing, Titus again said, I will give thee forty
groats, and as a pledge, take my girdle, which he gave him before
he had done speaking, that he might not open his mouth, or make
a noise.</p>

<p class="footnote1c">When the Lady St. Mary saw the kindness which this robber did
show them, she said to him, The Lord God will receive thee to his
right hand, and grant thee pardon of thy sins.</p>

<p class="footnote1c">Then the Lord Jesus answered and said to his mother, When
thirty years are expired, O Mother, the Jews will crucify me at
Jerusalem.</p>

<p class="footnote1c">And these two thieves shall be with me at the same time upon
the cross, Titus on my right hand, and Dumachus on my left, and
from that time Titus shall go before me into Paradise."</p>

Alexander was king. In this countrey was Aristotle

there is an aulter on his tombe, and there they make a

and is as high as the cloudes, and the other hill that
men call Athos is so highe, that the shadow of him

church of Saint Sophy, an Emperour wold haue layd
the body of his father when he was dead, and as they
made the grave they found a body in the earth &amp; upon
that body lay a great plate of fine gold &amp; there upon
was written in Ebrew, Greke &amp; Latin letters that sayde
thus: <i>Jesus Christus nascetur de virgine Marie, et ego
credo in eum</i>. That is to say, Jesu Christ shal be borne
of the Virgin Mary &amp; I believe in him. And the date
was that it lay in the earthe 200<a id="footnotetagcpii7" name="footnotetagcpii7"></a><a href="#footnotecpii7"><sup>7</sup></a> yeare before our Lord

that men of Grece be Christen, yet they vary from our

out of the sonne, but all onely of the father, and as they
are not obedient to the Church of Rome, nor to the
Pope, and they saye that theyr Patryarkes haue as much
power over the sea, as the Pope hath on this syde the
sea. And therefore Pope John the XXII. sente letters
to them, how Christen fayth should be all one, and that
they shoulde be obedient to a pope that is Christes
Vykar in earthe, to whome God gave plaine<a id="footnotetagcpii9" name="footnotetagcpii9"></a><a href="#footnotecpii9"><sup>9</sup></a> power to
binde and to assoyle,<a id="footnotetagcpii10" name="footnotetagcpii10"></a><a href="#footnotecpii10"><sup>10</sup></a> and therefore they should be
obedient to him. And they sent him divers aunsweres,
and among other they said thus. <i>Potentiam tuam summam

shoulde wed but once, and who so weddeth more than
once theyr children are bastards and gotten in sinne,
and theyr priestes also are wedded, and they say that
usury or simony is no deadly sinne and they sell benefices
of holy churche, and so did men of other places
and is great sclaunder,<a id="footnotetagcpii17" name="footnotetagcpii17"></a><a href="#footnotecpii17"><sup>17</sup></a> for now is Simony King crowned
in holy churche, God amende it when his will is. And
they say that in Lent men should not singe masse but
on the Saterday and on the Sonday, and they fast not
the Saterday no tyme in the yeare, but if it be Christmas
or Easter even. And they suffer no man that is on this
side the Grece sea to sing at theyr aulters, and if it fall
that they do through any hap,<a id="footnotetagcpii18" name="footnotetagcpii18"></a><a href="#footnotecpii18"><sup>18</sup></a> they wash theyr aulters
as sone without tarieng with holy water, and they say
that there should be but one masse sayde at one aulter
in a day. And they say that our Lorde did neuer eate
meate but that he made a token<a id="footnotetagcpii19" name="footnotetagcpii19"></a><a href="#footnotecpii19"><sup>19</sup></a> of eating. And also
they say that we sinne deadly in shaving of our berdes,
for the berde is a token of a man, and a gift of our Lord
and they saye that we sinne in eating of beastes that
were defended<a id="footnotetagcpii20" name="footnotetagcpii20"></a><a href="#footnotecpii20"><sup>20</sup></a> in the olde lawe, as swyne, hares and

<p>And thus they saye that we sinne in eating of fleshe
on the dayes before Ashwednesday, and in eating of
fleshe on the Wednesdaye, and when we eate chese or
egges on the Fryday and they curse all those that eate
no fleshe on the Saterday. Also the Emperour of Constantinople

Calliste, which Ferrarius, in his <i>Lexicon Geographicum</i> (edit.
1670), says is an island in the &AElig;gean Sea. The other islands have
different names in different MSS., but are not worth the trouble of
identifying, except Lampne as Lemnos&mdash;where Mandeville places
Mount Athos. <i>Plutarch</i> and <i>Pliny</i> said that, in the summer
solstice this mountain projected its shadow on the market-place of
Myrina, the capital city of Lemnos, and that a brazen cow was
there erected to mark the termination of the shadow; but this is
as probable as the distance given, namely, seventy-seven miles,
which is manifestly erroneous. The spelling of the geographical
names is very bad, and renders it a difficult task to identify them:
for instance, if it were not a well-known fact that Aristoteles was
born and buried at Stagira, it would be very difficult to identify
Strages as being the same place. Again, Olimphus is used instead
of Lemnos, in connection with the shadow of Mount Athos.</p>

Jebus and sythen it was called Salem unto the time of
King David, and he set those two names togither and
called it Hierusalem and so it is called yet. And aboute
Hierusalem is the Kingdome of Surry, &amp; thereby is
the lande of Palestyne and Askalon, but Hierusalem is
in the lande of Jude, and it is called Judee, for Judas
Maccabeus was King of that lande, and also it marcheth
afterward on the Kingedome of Araby, on the South
side on the lande of Egipt, on the west side on the great

Church, where that the holy grave is, the whiche is
out of the citie on the North syde, but it is now closed

ryght well and richly of gold and asure and other

them to breake the stones in peces or pouder, therefore
the Soudan hath made a wall about the sepulchre that no

therein is many lampes light, and there is a lampe that
hangeth before the sepulcre lyght brenning and on the

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N that Churche of the sepulcre on the north syde is
the place where our Lord was done<a id="footnotetagcpxxi1" name="footnotetagcpxxi1"></a><a href="#footnotecpxxi1"><sup>1</sup></a> (<i>in</i>) prison, and
there is a part of the cheyne with which he was bound,
and there he appeared fyrst to Mary Magdeleyne when
he was risen from death and she trowed<a id="footnotetagcpxxi2" name="footnotetagcpxxi2"></a><a href="#footnotecpxxi2"><sup>2</sup></a> that he had
bene a gardeiner. In the Church of the sepulcre was
wont to be<a id="footnotetagcpxxi3" name="footnotetagcpxxi3"></a><a href="#footnotecpxxi3"><sup>3</sup></a> Chanons of sainct Benet and they had a
pryour; but the Patryarke was theyr soveraigne.</p>

<p>And without the dores of the Churche on the righte
syde as men go up xviii grees,<a id="footnotetagcpxxi4" name="footnotetagcpxxi4"></a><a href="#footnotecpxxi4"><sup>4</sup></a> our Lorde sayde to his

is to say, Then said he to his disciple, Behold thy
mother.<a id="footnotetagcpxxi6" name="footnotetagcpxxi6"></a><a href="#footnotecpxxi6"><sup>6</sup></a> And these wordes he sayde when he hanged
upon the crosse. And upon these greces went our
Lorde when he bare the crosse uppon his shoulder, and
under these greces is a Chappell where the priestes
synge, but not after our lawe, and alway they make
theyr Sacrament of the aulter of bread, say <i>Pater noster</i>
&amp;c., and other prayers, as with the which thing they say
the wordes of whome the sacrament is made, for they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[pg 56]</span>
know not of the addicions that many Popes haue made
but they singe in good devocion. And nere there is the
stone wher our Lord rested him when he was wery for
bearing of the crosse. And ye shall understand that
before the Churche of the Sepulcre is the citie most
strong<a id="footnotetagcpxxi7" name="footnotetagcpxxi7"></a><a href="#footnotecpxxi7"><sup>7</sup></a> for the great playne that is betwene the citie
&amp; the church; on the East side without the walles of
the citie is the vale of Josaphat that commeth to the
walles. In that vale of Josaphat without the citie, is the
churche of sainct Stephen where he was stoned to death,
and thereby is the gate gylted that may not be opened.
Through this gate our Lord entred on palme Sonday
upon an asse, and the gate opened against him whan he
would go to the Temple, and yet are the steppes of the
asse sene in three places the which stand<a id="footnotetagcpxxi8" name="footnotetagcpxxi8"></a><a href="#footnotecpxxi8"><sup>8</sup></a> in full harde

paces, is a great hospitall of Sainct John, in the which
hospytall are liiii pyllers made of stone.</p>

<p class="title1"><i>Yet of the temple of God.</i></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>ND ye shall understande that this is not the temple
that Salomon made, for that temple lasted but a
thousand, an hundred and two yeare. For Titus, Vespasianus
Son, that was Emperour of Rome that layde
syege about Hierusalem for to discomfyte the Jewes, for
they hadde put Chryst to death without leave of the
Emperour, and when he had taken the citie he did
brenne the temple and caste it downe, and toke all the
Jewes and put to death CXIM and the other he put in
prison, and solde xxx for a peny for they sayd that they
bought Jesu Christ for xxx pence. And sithen<a id="footnotetagcpxxiii1" name="footnotetagcpxxiii1"></a><a href="#footnotecpxxiii1"><sup>1</sup></a> gave
Julian Apostata leve to y<sup>e</sup> Jewes to make the Temple
of Hierusalem againe for he hated christen men, and
yet he was Chrysten, but he forsoke his lawe. And whan
the Jewes hadde made the Temple, then came an earthe
quacke (as God woulde) and caste downe all that they
had made. Sythen Adryan the Emperour that was of
them of Troye made Hierusalem againe and the Temple
in that same maner that Salomon made it, and would
that no Jewe should dwell there but all christen men,
for if all it were<a id="footnotetagcpxxiii2" name="footnotetagcpxxiii2"></a><a href="#footnotecpxxiii2"><sup>2</sup></a> so that he was not chrystened, he loved
the christen men more than other men, save men of his
owne fayth. And this emperour dyd enclose and wall
the church of the holy sepulcre within the citie, that
before was farre without the citie, and he would have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[pg 60]</span>
chaunged the name of Hierusalem and called it Helyam,<a id="footnotetagcpxxiii3" name="footnotetagcpxxiii3"></a><a href="#footnotecpxxiii3"><sup>3</sup></a>
but that name lasted not longe. And ye shall wete<a id="footnotetagcpxxiii4" name="footnotetagcpxxiii4"></a><a href="#footnotecpxxiii4"><sup>4</sup></a>
that the Sarasins do greate worship to that Temple and
they saye that place is right holy, and when they go
therein they go bare foote and knele many times downe.
And when I and my felowes came therein, we did of<a id="footnotetagcpxxiii5" name="footnotetagcpxxiii5"></a><a href="#footnotecpxxiii5"><sup>5</sup></a>
our harnesse<a id="footnotetagcpxxiii6" name="footnotetagcpxxiii6"></a><a href="#footnotecpxxiii6"><sup>6</sup></a> and came bare foote into the Temple &amp;
thought that we should doe as much or more than they
that were mistrowing.<a id="footnotetagcpxxiii7" name="footnotetagcpxxiii7"></a><a href="#footnotecpxxiii7"><sup>7</sup></a>
And this Temple is three score<a id="footnotetagcpxxiii8" name="footnotetagcpxxiii8"></a><a href="#footnotecpxxiii8"><sup>8</sup></a>
and three cubites of wydenesse and as much of length
and xxxii<a id="footnotetagcpxxiii9" name="footnotetagcpxxiii9"></a><a href="#footnotecpxxiii9"><sup>9</sup></a> cubites in height and covered with lead and
it is within full of pillers of Marble. And in the middes
of the Temple is a stage of twenty<a id="footnotetagcpxxiii10" name="footnotetagcpxxiii10"></a><a href="#footnotecpxxiii10"><sup>10</sup></a> and foure greces of
height and good pillers all about. This place called
of Jewes <i>Sancta Sanctorum</i>. That is to say Holy of
Holyest and in that place cometh none but their
prelate that maketh theyr sacrafyce, and the people
standeth all about in divers stages, after they are<a id="footnotetagcpxxiii11" name="footnotetagcpxxiii11"></a><a href="#footnotecpxxiii11"><sup>11</sup></a> of
dignitie and worshippe, and there be foure entrings into
that Temple and the dores are of Cipres well dighte,<a id="footnotetagcpxxiii12" name="footnotetagcpxxiii12"></a><a href="#footnotecpxxiii12"><sup>12</sup></a>
and within the East dore our Lord sayd, here is Hierusalem.
And on the northe syde within the dore is a
fountaine but it runneth not; of the which holy writ
speaketh &amp; saith thus&mdash;<i>Vidi aquam egredientem de
templo</i>. That is to saye, I saw water comming out of
the temple. And upon the other side is a roche that
men calle sometyme Moryach, but after it was called
Belet,<a id="footnotetagcpxxiii13" name="footnotetagcpxxiii13"></a><a href="#footnotecpxxiii13"><sup>13</sup></a> or the arke of God, with the reliques of the
Jewes. Thys arke did Titus cary with him to Rome
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>[pg 61]</span>
when he had discomfited all the Jewes. In that same
arke were the ten commandementes and Aarons rodde
and Moyses rodde with which he departed<a id="footnotetagcpxxiii14" name="footnotetagcpxxiii14"></a><a href="#footnotecpxxiii14"><sup>14</sup></a> the red sea,
when the people of Israeli passed through on dryefoote
&amp; with that rod he did many wonders, and there was the
vessell of gold ful of manna, &amp; clothing &amp; ornaments &amp;
the tabernacle of Aaron, and a table square of golde
with twelve precious stones, &amp; a box of Jasper graven
with four figures &amp; eight names of our Lorde within,
&amp; seven candlesticks of golde, &amp; foure sensers of golde,
and an aulter also of fine gold &amp; foure lions of gold,
uppon the which they had Cherubin of gold twelve
spanne long, &amp; a tabernacle of golde &amp; also twelve<a id="footnotetagcpxxiii15" name="footnotetagcpxxiii15"></a><a href="#footnotecpxxiii15"><sup>15</sup></a>
trumpets of silver &amp; a table of sylver &amp; seven barly
loves and all other reliques that were before the nativitie
of Jesu. Also upon this roch slept Jacob, when he sawe
Aungels go up and downe, and sayde, <i>Vere locus iste
sanctus est, et ego ignorabam</i>, That is to say Forsooth this
place is holy &amp; I wist<a id="footnotetagcpxxiii16" name="footnotetagcpxxiii16"></a><a href="#footnotecpxxiii16"><sup>16</sup></a> it not. And there the Aungel
chaunged Jacob's name and called him Israell. And in
that same place David saw the aungell that slew the
people with a sworde, and put it all blody in the shethe.
And in this roch was saynct Symeon when he received
our Lorde into the temple, and on this roch he set him
when the Jewes would have stoned him and the roch
rived in two and in that refte<a id="footnotetagcpxxiii17" name="footnotetagcpxxiii17"></a><a href="#footnotecpxxiii17"><sup>17</sup></a> he hid him and after a
sterre came downe &amp; gave him light. And on this roch
sat our Lady and learned hir sauter.<a id="footnotetagcpxxiii18" name="footnotetagcpxxiii18"></a><a href="#footnotecpxxiii18"><sup>18</sup></a> And there forgave
our Lord the sinnes of the woman that was taken
and found in adoultry, and there was our Lorde Jesu
Christ circumcised, and there the Aungell denounced to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[pg 62]</span>
Zachary the nativitie of sainct Jhon Baptist, and there
offred fyrst Melchisedech bread and wine and water to
our Lorde in tokening of the sacrament that was to
come, and there fell Davyd, praying to our Lorde for
mercy for him and for his people, when he sawe the
Aungell slea<a id="footnotetagcpxxiii19" name="footnotetagcpxxiii19"></a><a href="#footnotecpxxiii19"><sup>19</sup></a> his people, and our Lorde anon herde his
prayer, &amp; therefore woulde he make the Temple in that
place, but our Lorde Jesu Christ forbadde hym by an
Aungell, for he had done treason when he did slea
Euryas, a good knight, for to haue his wyfe. And therefore
all that he had ordeined for to make the Temple
he betoke<a id="footnotetagcpxxiii20" name="footnotetagcpxxiii20"></a><a href="#footnotecpxxiii20"><sup>20</sup></a> it to Salomon hys sonne, and he made it,
and he prayed our Lorde, that all those that prayed in
that place devoutly, and wyth good hearte, that he
woulde heare theyr prayer and graunt that they asked
ryght wysely, and our Lorde graunted it, and therefore
Salomons son called it the Temple of counseyll and
helpe of God. Wythout the dores of that Temple is an
auter, where Jewes were wont to offer doves<a id="footnotetagcpxxiii21" name="footnotetagcpxxiii21"></a><a href="#footnotecpxxiii21"><sup>21</sup></a> and turtylles,
and in that Temple was Zachary slayne, and on
that pynacle the Jewes sette Sainct James that was the
fyrst Byshoppe of Hierusalem. And a lyttle from this
temple on the right syde, is a church covered with lead,
that is called the scole<a id="footnotetagcpxxiii22" name="footnotetagcpxxiii22"></a><a href="#footnotecpxxiii22"><sup>22</sup></a> of Salomon. And toward the
south is the temple of Salomon that is full fayre, and a
greate place, and in this place dwell knightes y<sup>t</sup> are
called Templars and that was the founder thereof and
of theyr order and in that Templum Domini dwell
Chanons. From this Temple towarde the East xxvi<a id="footnotetagcpxxiii23" name="footnotetagcpxxiii23"></a><a href="#footnotecpxxiii23"><sup>23</sup></a>
paces in a corner of the citie, is the bathe of our Lorde,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[pg 63]</span>
and (<i>in</i>) thys bath was wont to go<a id="footnotetagcpxxiii24" name="footnotetagcpxxiii24"></a><a href="#footnotecpxxiii24"><sup>24</sup></a> to Paradise &amp; beside
is our Ladies bed and nere there is the tombe of Saynt
Symeon. And without the Cloyster of the Temple
towarde the North is a ryght fayre Churche of Sainct
Anne our Ladies mother, &amp; there was our ladye conceyved,
and before that churche is a great tree that
began to grow that same nighte. And as men go downe
from y<sup>t</sup> Church xxii greces lieth Joachim our ladyes
father, in a tombe of stone and there nere was layde
sometyme sainct Anne, but saint Eleyne did translate
hir to Constantinople. In this churche is a well in maner
of a cesterne that is called <i>Probatica piscina</i> that hath
five entrings, and in that cesterne was wont an Aungell
to discende and sterre the water, and what man that
bathed him firste therein after the morning,<a id="footnotetagcpxxiii25" name="footnotetagcpxxiii25"></a><a href="#footnotecpxxiii25"><sup>25</sup></a> was made
hole that was sicke, what sycknesse so euer he had, and
there was the man of the palsye made hole, that was
sicke xxxviii yeare and our Lorde sayde to him in this
maner of wyse <i>Tolle grabatum tuum et ambula</i>. That is
to say, take thy bed and go. And there besyde, was
the house of Pylate and a little thence was the house of
Kinge Herode that dyd slea the Innocentes.</p>

<p>And on the other syde towarde the south as men go
to mount Syon is a fayre church of sainct James where
his head was smitten of, and there is mounte Syon
and there is a fayre church of God and of our Lady
where she was dwelling and dyed, and there was
sometime an Abbey of Chanons regulers and from that
place she was borne of the Apostles unto the Vale of
Josaphat. And there is the stone that y<sup>e</sup> aungel bare
to our ladye from mount Synay &amp; it is of that colour
that the roche of Sainct Katheryne is of, and there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[pg 67]</span>
besyde is the gate where our Ladye when she was with
Childe went through to Bethlem. Also at the entrynge
of Mount Syon is a chappell and in that Chapell is that
stone greate and large, with which the Sepulcre was
covered when Christe was layde therein, the which stone
as it is wrytten y<sup>e</sup> three Maryes saw turned upward when
they came to the sepulcre, and they found an Aungell
that sayd to them, that Christ was rysen from death to
lyfe. And there is a litle piller to the which our Lord
was bounde and scourged, and there was Anas house
that was bishop of the Jewes in that time, and in that
same place forsoke Saint Peter our Lord thrise before
the Cocke crewe. And there is a part of the table on
the which God made his maunde with his disciples &amp; yet
is there the vessell with water out of the which his disciples
feete were washed, and thereby is Sainct Stephens
grave and there is the Aulter where our Lady heard the
Aungels sing masse and there appeared Christ fyrst to
his disciples after his resurrection, and when the gates

Peace be to you. And on that Mount apeared Christ to
Sainct Thomas, and badde him assaye hys Wounde, and
that was the viii daye after his resurrection and then he
beleved perfectly &amp; sayde <i>Dominus meus &amp; deus meus</i>.
That is to say in English, My Lorde &amp; my God. In
that same Chappell behind the highe aulter were all
the Apostles on Witsonday, when the holy ghoste
descended on them in likenesse of fyre, and there made
God Paske<a id="footnotetagcpxxv2" name="footnotetagcpxxv2"></a><a href="#footnotecpxxv2"><sup>2</sup></a> with his disciples, and there slepte Saynt
Jhon the Evangelyst on our Lordes breast and saw sleping
many privy things of heaven. And mount Syon is
within the Citie, and it is a lyttle hygher than the other
syde of the Citie, and that Citie is stronger on that one
syde than on the other, for at the fote of mount Syon is
a fayre Castell &amp; strong which the Soudan did cause to
be made there. On mount Syon was King David buried

that is another place where our Lord was judged, for
that time was there Caiphas house &amp; betwene that Temple
(<i>of</i>) Salomon and Mount Sion is the place where
Christ raysed the mayden from death to lyfe. Under

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>ND in this countrey &amp; in many other landes over

cities or castels beseged so strongly that they may send
no messages to any lordes for socour then they write
their letters &amp; binde them about the neckes of doves and
let them flie their wayes, bicause the dove is of that
nature that he will returne againe to the place where he
is brought up, and thus they do commonly in that countrey.
And ye shal wete that among the Sarasins in
many places dwel christen men under tribute and they
are of divers maners, and divers maners of monkes, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>[pg 88]</span>
they are all christened and have divers lawes, but they
all beleve well in our Lord God, the father, the sonne, &amp;
in the Holy ghost, but yet they fayle in the articles of
our faith, and they are called Jacobyns. For sainct
James converted theym to the fayth, and sainct John
baptised them, and they say that men shall onely shryve<a id="footnotetagcpxxxix1" name="footnotetagcpxxxix1"></a><a href="#footnotecpxxxix1"><sup>1</sup></a>
them unto God, &amp; not unto man for they saye that God
bad not man shryve him unto another man. And therefore
saith David in the Psalter in this maner of wise,
<i>Confitebor tibi, domine in toto Corde meo, &amp;c.</i> That is to
saye, Lord I shall shrive me unto thee in all my hart.
And in another place he saith thus, <i>Delictum meum tibi
cognitum feci</i>. That is to saye, My trespasse I have
made knowne unto thee. And in another place, <i>Deus
meus es tu &amp; confitebor tibi</i>. That is to saye, Thou art
my god and I shall be shriven to thee. And in another
place <i>Quoniam cogitatio hominis confitebitur tibi</i>, &amp;c.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[pg 89]</span>
That is to say, The thought of man shal be shriven to
thee, and they knowe well the Bible and Psalter but
they say it not in latin, but in their owne language, and
they saye that David and other prophetes have sayde it.
But Sainct Austyn and Saynct Gregory say, <i>Qui scelera
sua cogitat, &amp; conversus fecerit, veniam sibi credat</i>, That
is to say, Who so knowith his syn and turneth, he may
beleve to have forgivenesse. And Sainct Gregory sayth
thus, <i>Dominus potius mentem, quam verbum considerat</i>,
That is to saye, Our Lord taketh more kepe<a id="footnotetagcpxxxix2" name="footnotetagcpxxxix2"></a><a href="#footnotecpxxxix2"><sup>2</sup></a> to thought,
than to worde, and Sainct Hilarius sayth, <i>Longorum temporum
crimina, ictu oculi pereunt, si cordis nata fuerit
compunctio</i>, That is to say, Synnes that are done of olde
tyme perysh in twinkling of an eye, if despising of them
be born in a mans heart. And therefore say they, men
shal shrive them onely to God, by these authorities,
&amp; this (<i>it</i>) was the Apostles, &amp; popes that came sithen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>[pg 90]</span>
haue ordeyned, that men shall shrive them to priestes
&amp; men as they are, &amp; the cause is this, for they saye that
a man that hath a sicknesse, men may giue him no good
medecines but they know y<sup>t</sup> kinde of the sicknesse, also
they say a man may give no covenable<a id="footnotetagcpxxxix3" name="footnotetagcpxxxix3"></a><a href="#footnotecpxxxix3"><sup>3</sup></a> penaunce but if
he know y<sup>e</sup> sin. For there is a maner of synne that is
grevouser to one man than it is to another, and therefore
it is nedefull that a man should know and understande
the kinde of sinne. And there be also other men that
men call Surryens and they hold halfe our faith, and

<p><span class="dropcap">N</span>OW haue I tolde you some wayes by land and by

it be so that there be many other wayes that men go by,
after the countreys that they come from, neverthelesse
they tourne all to one ende, yet is there a way all by
land to Hierusalem, &amp; passe no sea from Fraunce or
Flaunders, but that way is full longe and perylous &amp; of
great travaile, &amp; therefore few go that way, he that goeth
that way, he goeth through Almayn &amp; Pruse and so to
Tartary, this Tartary is holden of the great Cane,<a id="footnotetagcpxliii1" name="footnotetagcpxliii1"></a><a href="#footnotecpxliii1"><sup>1</sup></a> of

his lordeshippe, and all the lords of Tartary yelde to him
tribute. Tartary is a full evill land, sandy and a lytle
fruite bearing, for there groweth but little corne or fruyte,
but bestes are there great plentie, and therefore eate
they but fleshe without breade, and they sup the broth,
and they drynke mylke of all maner of bestes, they eat
Cattes, and all maner of wyld bestes, rattes &amp; myce, and
they haue but lyttle wodde,<a id="footnotetagcpxliii3" name="footnotetagcpxliii3"></a><a href="#footnotecpxliii3"><sup>3</sup></a>

theyr meate with horse dounge &amp; other bestes doung,
when it is dry. Princes and other lordes eate but ones
in the day, and ryght lyttle, and they be ryght foule
folke, and of evyll lyking, and in somer there is many
tempests and thonders, that sleaeth many men &amp; bestes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>[pg 98]</span>
(<i>sodainly it is</i>) right colde, and sodainly it is right hot.
The Prince that governeth that land they call him Roco
and he dwelleth at a Citie that men call Orda, and forsoth
there is no man that will dwell in that lande, for it
is good to sow in thornes &amp; wedes, other good is there
none, as I herd say, for I was not that way, but I have
bene in other lordes landes marching thereon, and the
land of Rossye and Nyflonde &amp; the Kingedome of Grecon<a id="footnotetagcpxliii5" name="footnotetagcpxliii5"></a><a href="#footnotecpxliii5"><sup>5</sup></a>
and Lectowe, and the kingdome of Grasten<a id="footnotetagcpxliii6" name="footnotetagcpxliii6"></a><a href="#footnotecpxliii6"><sup>6</sup></a> &amp; in many
other places, but I went neuer that way to Hierusalem
&amp; therefore I may not tell it, for I haue understande,
that men may not well go that way but in winter, when
the waters and marys<a id="footnotetagcpxliii7" name="footnotetagcpxliii7"></a><a href="#footnotecpxliii7"><sup>7</sup></a> that be in that lande be
frosen and covered with snow, so that men may passe
thereon, for were not the snow, there might no man go
in that lande but he wer lost. And ye shall understande
that a man shall go three days journey from Pruse to
passe this waye, tyll he come to the lande of Sarasyns,
that men dwell in. And if by fortune any christen men
passe that way, as once a yeare they doe, they cary theyr
vitale with them, for they shoulde finde nothing there
but a maner of things that they call Syleys, and they
cary theyr vytales upon the yce on sleddes<a id="footnotetagcpxliii8" name="footnotetagcpxliii8"></a><a href="#footnotecpxliii8"><sup>8</sup></a> and charyottes
without wheles, and as long as theyr vitayles laste, they
may dwell there, but no longer. And when spyes of the
countrey see christen men come, they runne to the towns
and castels and cry right loude, Kera, Kera, Kera, and
as sone as they haue cryed, then dothe the people arme
them. And ye shall understande that the yse there is
harder than it is here, and euery man hath a stew<a id="footnotetagcpxliii9" name="footnotetagcpxliii9"></a><a href="#footnotecpxliii9"><sup>9</sup></a> in
his house, and therein they eat and do all things that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>[pg 99]</span>
them nedeth. And that is at the North part of the
world, where it is commonly colde, for the Sonne cometh
ne shineth but a little in that countrey, and that lande is
in some places so colde, that there may no man dwel
therein, and on the South side of the world it is in some
places so hote, that there can no man dwel, the son
giveth so great heate in those countreys.</p>

And if a man aske of what Paradise they meane,
they say it is a place of delytes, where a man shall finde

was chosen before all other from the beginning of
the world, and that wytnesseth well theyr booke, &amp;
Gabriel tolde hir of the incarnation of Jesu Christ, and
that she shoulde conceive and beare a childe and they
saye that Christ was a holy prophet in word &amp; dede, and
also meke &amp; rightwise to all men, and without any
blame worthy. And they saye that when the Aungell
tolde hir of the incarnation, she hadde great dread,
for she was righte younge, and there was one in the
countrey that medled with sorcery, that men called
Takina,<a id="footnotetagcpxliiii6" name="footnotetagcpxliiii6"></a><a href="#footnotecpxliiii6"><sup>6</sup></a> that with enchauntements could make him lyke
an Aungell and he went often and lay with maidens, and
therefore was Mary the more aferde<a id="footnotetagcpxliiii7" name="footnotetagcpxliiii7"></a><a href="#footnotecpxliiii7"><sup>7</sup></a> of the Aungell, and
thought in hir mynde that it had bene Takina that went
to maydens, and she conjured him that he should tell
hir if he were the same Takina, and the Aungell bad hir
have no dreade for he was for certayne a true messenger
of Jesu Christ. Also theyr booke of Alkaron saith, that
she had a child under a palme tree, then was she greatly
ashamed and sayde that she woulde she had bene dead.
As sone as hir childe was borne, he spake and comforted
hir and sayd, <i>Ne timeas Maria</i>, That is to say, Be not
afraide Mary. And in many other places, sayth theyr
booke Alkaron, that Jesu Christ spake as sone as he was
borne, &amp; the booke sayth that Jesu Christ was sent of
Almighty God to be ensample to all men, and that God
shall deme<a id="footnotetagcpxliiii8" name="footnotetagcpxliiii8"></a><a href="#footnotecpxliiii8"><sup>8</sup></a> all men, the good to heaven and the wicked

Angelus</i>, they doe it great worship, they fast a moneth in
the yere &amp; they eate but in the night, and they kepe
them from theyr wyves, but they that are syke are not
Constrayned to that. And that booke Alkaron speaketh
of Jewes and sayth, they are wicked people for they will
not beleve that Jesu Christ is of God. And they say, y<sup>t</sup>
the Jewes lye on our Lady and hir sonne Jesu Christ,
saying that they did him not on the crosse, for Sarasyns

when men preche the lawe of Jesu Christ, and they saye
that they wote well by theyr prophicies, that theyr lawe
of Machomet shall fayll as doth the law of Jews and that
Christen mens laws shall last unto the worlds ende. And
if a man aske them wherein they beleve they say that
they beleve in god almightie, that is the maker of heaven

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>LSO Machomet badde in his boke Alkaron, that
euery man shoulde haue two wives or three or
foure, but now they take nine and as many lemmans as
them liketh, &amp; if any of their wives doe amisse against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>[pg 102]</span>
their husbandes, he may driue hir out of his house, and
take another, but he must giue to hir part of his goodes.
Also when men speake of the Father, and the Sonne, and
holy Ghost, they saye they are three persons, but not
one God, for their boke Alkoran speaketh not thereof,
nor of the trinitie, but they say that God spake or else
he was dumb, and that God hath a ghost,<a id="footnotetagcpxlv1" name="footnotetagcpxlv1"></a><a href="#footnotecpxlv1"><sup>1</sup></a> or else he
were not alive, &amp; they say Gods word hath great strength,
and so saith theyr Alkaron &amp; they say that Abraham
and Moyses were greatly in favor with God, for they
spake with him, &amp; Machomet was right messenger of
God. And they haue many good articles of our faith
and some understand the scriptures, profites, gospels, and
the Bible, for they haue them written in theyr language,
in this maner they knowe holy writ, but they understande
it not, but after the letter and so do the Jewes, for they
understande it not, but after their letter ghostly, and
therefore saith Sainct Paule, <i>Litera occidit: Spiritus vivificat</i>&mdash;that
is to say, Letter dieth, and ghost maketh
quicke. And the Sarasins say y<sup>t</sup> Jewes are wicked, for
they kepe not y<sup>e</sup> lawe of Moyses the which he toke to
them, &amp; also chrysten men are yll, for they kepe not the
commaundments of the gospels that Jesu Christ sent
unto them &amp; therefore I shall tell you what the Soudan
tolde me upon a daye in his chamber, voiding<a id="footnotetagcpxlv2" name="footnotetagcpxlv2"></a><a href="#footnotecpxlv2"><sup>2</sup></a> out all
other men, as Lordes, Knightes &amp; other, for he woulde
speke with me in counsel, and then asked he me how
christen men governed them in our countrey and I
aunswered him &amp; sayd, right well thankes be to God;
&amp; he sayd, secretly nay, for he sayd that our priestes
made no force of gods service, for they shoulde giue good
example to men, to doe well, and they giue ill example,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>[pg 103]</span>
and therefore when the people should go on the holy
daies to church to serve God they go to the taverne to
sin in glotony both day and nighte, and eate and drink
as bestes, that wot not when they haue had ynough, and
also Christen men he sayde, inforced them to fight
together &amp; eche to begile other and they are so proude,
that they wot not how they may cloth them, now short,
now long, now straite now wyde, of all manner of fassions.
They shoulde be simple, meke and softe, and doe
theyr almes as Jesu Christe dyd, in whome they beleve,
and he sayde they are so covetouse, that for a lyttle
money they sell theyr children, theyr systers, and theyr
wyves, and one taketh another mans wife, and none
holdeth his fayth to other, therefore sayde he, for theyr
sinnes hath God given these landes to our handes, and
not through our strength, but all for your synnes. For
we wot well, that when that ye serve well your god,
that he wyll helpe you, so that no man shall winne of
you, if that ye serve your god as ye oughte to doe, but
while they lyve so sinfully as they doe, we have no
dread<a id="footnotetagcpxlv3" name="footnotetagcpxlv3"></a><a href="#footnotecpxlv3"><sup>3</sup></a> on them, for theyr God shall not helpe them.
And then I asked him how that he knew the state of
Chrysten men in that maner, &amp; he sayde that he knewe
well both of lordes and of commons, by his messengers
which he sent through all the countreys as it were merchants
with precious stones &amp; other marchandise to know
the manner of euery countrey. And then he did call
againe all the lordes into his chamber to us &amp; then
shewed he unto me iiii persons that were great lordes of
that countrey, that shewed me the maner of my countrey,
and of all Christendome, as though they had bene men
borne in the same partes, and they speak french right
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>[pg 104]</span>
well and the Soudain also, and then I had greate marvaile
of this slaunder of our faith and so they that should
bee turned by our good examples to the fayth of Jesu
Christe, they are drawen away through our evyl living,
and therefore it is no wonder if that they call us evyll,
for they saye soth, but the Sarasins are true for they
kepe truly the commaundements of their Alkaron that
God sent them by his messenger Machomet, to whome
they say, Gabryell the Aungell spake often, and tolde to

was but a lyttle house and a lowe, as sone as he entered,
it began to be as great as it were of a palas gate and
that was the first miracle that the Sarasyns saye that he
did in his youth. After began Machomet to be wise and
rich and became a great Astronomer, and sithen was he
keper of the lande of the prince Corodan and governed
it full well, in such maner that when the prince was dead
he maryed the lady y<sup>t</sup> men call Quadryge.<a id="footnotetagcpxlvi1" name="footnotetagcpxlvi1"></a><a href="#footnotecpxlvi1"><sup>1</sup></a> And

&amp; he made hir to understande that every tyme that he
fell so, he said that Gabriel the aungell spake to him,
and for the great brightnesse of the aungell he fell
downe. This Machomet raigned in Araby the yeare of
our Lord, vi hundred and xx<a id="footnotetagcpxlvi3" name="footnotetagcpxlvi3"></a><a href="#footnotecpxlvi3"><sup>3</sup></a> and he was of the kinde of
Ismael that was Abrahams son that he begat of Agar,
and other are called Sarasins of Sara, but some are
called Moabites and some Amenites after the two sons of
Loth. And also Machomet loved well a good man an
hermite that dwelled in the wildernesse a myle from
Mounte Sinay in the way as men go from Araby to
Caldee, and a dayes journey fro the sea where marchaunts
of Venice come, and Machomet went so often
to this hermyte that all his men were wroth, for he
harde<a id="footnotetagcpxlvi4" name="footnotetagcpxlvi4"></a><a href="#footnotecpxlvi4"><sup>4</sup></a> gladly the hermit preach, and his men did walke
all the night &amp; thought they would this hermyte were
dead. So it befell on a night that Machomet was full
dronken of good wine, and he fell in a slepe, and his men
toke Machomets sworde out of his sheath whyles he lay
and slept, and therewith they slew the Hermit, and afterwarde
they put up the sword againe all bloudy, and upon
the morow when that he founde the Hermite thus dead,
he was in his mynde verye angry, and right wroth, and
woulde haue done his men unto the death, but they all
with one accorde, and with one will sayde that he himselfe
hadde slaine hym when he was dronken, and they

became so greate a marchaunte bothe by sea and lande,

d'Arras, Secretary to the Duc de Berri, brother to Charles V. of
France&mdash;in 1387 (at the command of his master) is the legend of
the Lady of the Sparrow Hawk, which shows how current it was at
the time. According to his version, a fairy, named Presine, married
King Helmas, and made him vow that he would never go near her
at the time of childbirth. She bore him three daughters&mdash;Melusina,
Melior, and Palestine&mdash;and at the birth of the latter the king
broke his vow. When his children grew up they learnt this fact,
and were very indignant at their father's conduct, to punish which
(being gifted with supernatural power) they enclosed him in an enchanted
mountain until he died. Presine was powerless to undo
this deed, but she visited their unnatural conduct severely upon her
daughters. Melusina was to become half serpent, half woman, every
Saturday; Palestine was ever to watch their father's treasure on
the top of a mountain in Arragon; while Melior's fate is thus told
by the chronicler:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>FTER the lande of Caldee is the lande of Amazony
that is a land where there is no man but all women
as men say, for they wil suffer no men to lyve among
them nor to haue lordeshippe over them. For sometyme
was a kinge in that lande and men were dwelling there
as did in other countreys, and had wives, &amp; it befell that
the kynge had great warre with them of Sychy, he was
called Colopius and hee was slaine in bataill and all the
good bloude of his lande. And this queene when she herd
that, &amp; other ladies of that land, that the king and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>[pg 118]</span>
lordes were slaine, they gathered them togither and
killed all the men that were lefte in their lande among
them, and sithen that time dwelled no man among
them.</p>

<p>And when they will have any man they sende for
them in a countrey that is nere theyr lande, and the
men come and are ther viii dayes or as the woman
lyketh, &amp; then go they againe, and if they have men
children they send them to theyr fathers when they can
eate &amp; go, and if they have maide chyldren they kepe
them, and if they bee of gentill bloud they brene<a id="footnotetagcpl1" name="footnotetagcpl1"></a><a href="#footnotecpl1"><sup>1</sup></a> the

of little bloud they brene the ryght pappe away for
shoting. For those women of that countrey are good
warriours and are often in soudy<a id="footnotetagcpl3" name="footnotetagcpl3"></a><a href="#footnotecpl3"><sup>3</sup></a> with other lordes, and
the queene of that lande governeth well that lande, this

Like many other marvellous stories related by Sir John
Mandeville, they were told by Pliny, in his Natural History, nearly 1200
years previously. For instance, in Book 7, chap, li., devoted to
Man, he quotes Ctesias as saying that in India is another race of
men, who are known as Monocoli, who have only one leg, but are
able to leap with surprising agility. The same people are also
called Sciapod&oelig;, because they are in the habit of lying on their
backs during the time of extreme heat and protect themselves from
the sun by the shade of their feet. For other types of these "peculiar
people" see <a href="#page221">Appendix</a>.

<p><span class="dropcap">F</span>ROM Ethyope men go into Inde through many
dyverse countreys, and it is called Inde the more,
and it is departed in three parties, that is to say, Inde
the more that is a full hote lande, &amp; Inde the lesse
is a temperate land, and the thyrde part that is toward
the north there it is right cold, so that for greate colde,

so good for they are more softer and some are in Cipres
and in Macedony men also finde diamondes but the best
are in Inde &amp; some are founde many times in a masse
that cometh oute where men fynde golde from the myne
when men breake the masse in pyeces, and sometyme
men finde some of greatnesse of a pese,<a id="footnotetagcplii2" name="footnotetagcplii2"></a><a href="#footnotecplii2"><sup>2</sup></a> and some lesse,
and those are as harde as those of Inde, and all if it be
that men fynde good dyamondes in Indie upon the Roch of
Crystall, also menne finde good dyamondes upon the Roch
of Adamante<a id="footnotetagcplii3" name="footnotetagcplii3"></a><a href="#footnotecplii3"><sup>3</sup></a> in the sea and on hilles, as it were haysell

kynde, and they grow both togither, male and female,
and are noryshed with the dewe of heaven, and they
engendre commonly &amp; bring forth small children that
multiply &amp; growe all the yeare. I haue many times
assayed that if a man kepe them with a lyttle of the
roche, and wette them with many dewes oft times, they
shal grow euery yeare, and the small shall waxe greate.
And a manne shall bere the Diamonde in his left side,
and then it is of more vertue, for the strength of theyr
growing is toward the North, that is on the lefte side as
men of those countreys say. To him that beareth the
diamond upon him it giveth him hardinesse, it kepeth
his lims of his body hole, it giveth victory of<a id="footnotetagcplii5" name="footnotetagcplii5"></a><a href="#footnotecplii5"><sup>5</sup></a> enimies if
a mans cause be ryght, and hym that bereth it in good
will, it kepeth him from strife, from ryote, ill dreames,
and sorcerys, and enchauntements, and no wylde beste
shall greve him nor assaile him. And also the Dyamonde
shoulde be given freely without covetyse and
bying, &amp; then it is of more vertue, it healeth him that is
lunatyke, and he that is travailed with a divell, and if
venym or poyson be brought in the presence of the
Diamonde so soon it moysteth and beginneth to sweate,
and men may well polyce<a id="footnotetagcplii6" name="footnotetagcplii6"></a><a href="#footnotecplii6"><sup>6</sup></a> them to make men beleve
that they may not be polyshed. But men may assaye
them well in this maner, fyrst cut with them an diverse
precious stones, as Saphyrs or other uppon Crystall and
then men take a stone that is called Adamande, lay a
nedell before that Adamande and if the Diamond is
good &amp; vertuous the Adamande draweth not the nedell
to him whiles the Diamonde is there. And this is the
proof that they make beyonde the sea. But it falleth
sometime that the good diamond loseth his vertue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>[pg 123]</span>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>[pg 124]</span>
is more than fyve thousande yles that men dwell in
good and great, beside those that men dwel not in.
And in eche one of those is great plenty of cities and

they passe not out of theyr lande commonly, for they
dwell under a planet that is called Saturne, &amp; that planet

it be past none, and they ly all in the water but the face,
for the great heat that is there, and the women be not

so mighty that he helde war against King Alexander
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id="page126"></a>[pg 126]</span>
with great strength. Men of this yle have many maner
beleves and faithe &amp; have also diverse lawes, for some do
worship the Sunne, some the fyre, some the trees, &amp; some
the serpents, or any other thinge that they fyrst meete in
the morning, and some doe worship simulacres<a id="footnotetagcpliii5" name="footnotetagcpliii5"></a><a href="#footnotecpliii5"><sup>5</sup></a> and
Idoles, but betwene symulacres &amp; ydoles is no<a id="footnotetagcpliii6" name="footnotetagcpliii6"></a><a href="#footnotecpliii6"><sup>6</sup></a> difference,
and that is to understande, ymages made to what
lykenesse of thing that man may invent, for some ymage
hath an head lyke an Oxe, some haue three or foure
heddes, on of a man or an hors or Oxe or any other best
that no man hath seene. And ye shall understande
that they that worship symulacres they worship them as
for worthy men that were sometime, as Hercules, and
other that dyd many mervayles in theyr tymes. For
they saye they know well that they are not god of
kynde<a id="footnotetagcpliii7" name="footnotetagcpliii7"></a><a href="#footnotecpliii7"><sup>7</sup></a>
that made all thinges, but that they are wel<a id="footnotetagcpliii8" name="footnotetagcpliii8"></a><a href="#footnotecpliii8"><sup>8</sup></a>
with god for the mervayles that they did, and therefore
they worship them. And so say they of the sonne, for
it chaungeth oft tymes, for it giueth sometime great
heate for to nourych<a id="footnotetagcpliii9" name="footnotetagcpliii9"></a><a href="#footnotecpliii9"><sup>9</sup></a> all things on earth, &amp; bicause it
is of so greate profyte they knowe well that it is not God
but it is well with God &amp; that God loveth it more than
any other thing, and for this cause they worshippe it.
And also they saye theyr reasons of other planettes, and
of fyre also, for it is profitable, and nedefull. And of
ydolls they say the Oxe is the holyest that they may
finde here in earthe, and more profitable than any other,
for he doth much good, and none ille, and they knowe
well that it maye not bee without the speciall grace of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>[pg 127]</span>
God, and therefore they make theyr God of an Oxe, the
one halfe, and the other halfe a man, for man is the
fairest and the best creature of the worlde. And they
doe worship to serpentes, and other beastes that they
fyrste meete with in the morninge, and namely those
bestes that have good, meting after whome they speake<a id="footnotetagcpliii10" name="footnotetagcpliii10"></a><a href="#footnotecpliii10"><sup>10</sup></a>
well all the day after, the which they have proved of
long time, &amp; therefore they say that this meting cometh
of Gods grace, and therefore they doe make ymages lyke
unto those things that they may worship them before
they meete anythinges else. And there are some christen
men that say that some bestes are better for to meet
than some, for hares, swine, and other bestes are ill to
meete first, as they saye. In this yle of Cana is many
wilde bestes, &amp; rattes in that countrey are as great as
houndes here, and they take them with mastifes, for
cattes may not take them. Fro thence men come to a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>[pg 128]</span>
citie that men call Sarchys, and it is a faire and a goode
citie and there dwell many christen men of Gods faith,
and there be men of religion. From thence men come
to the land of Lombe &amp; in that lande groweth peper in
a forest that men call Tomber &amp; it groweth in none other
place more in all the worlde than in that forest, and that
forest is well L<a id="footnotetagcpliii11" name="footnotetagcpliii11"></a><a href="#footnotecpliii11"><sup>11</sup></a> daies journey. And there by the lande
of Lombe is the Citie of Polomes,<a id="footnotetagcpliii12" name="footnotetagcpliii12"></a><a href="#footnotecpliii12"><sup>12</sup></a> and under that Citie
is an hyll that men call Polombe and thereof taketh the
citie his name. And so at the fote of the same hill is a
right faire and a clere well, that hath a full good and
sweete savoure, and it smelleth of all maner of sortes of
spyces, and also at eche houre of the daye it changeth
his savour diversly, and who drinketh thries on the daye
of that well, he is made hole of all maner (<i>of</i>) sickenesse
that he hathe. I have sometime dronke of that
well, and methinketh yet that I fare the better; some
call it the well of youth, for they that drinke thereof
seme to be yong alway, and live without great sicknesse,
and they saye this well, cometh from Paradise terrestre,
for it is so vertuous, and in this lande groweth ginger,
and thither come many good marchauntes for spyces.
In this countrey men worship the Oxe for his great simpleness
and mekenesse, and the profite that is in him,
for they make the Oxe to travaile vi or vii yere and then
men do eate him. And the Kinge of that land hath
euermore one Oxe with him, and he that kepeth him
euery day taketh hys fees for the keping. And also
euery daye he gathereth his uryne and his dong in a
vessell of gold, and bereth it to the prelate that they call,
Archi porta papaton<a id="footnotetagcpliii13" name="footnotetagcpliii13"></a><a href="#footnotecpliii13"><sup>13</sup></a> and the prelate bereth it to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>[pg 129]</span>
King, and maketh thereupon a great blessing and then
the King putteth his hande therein, and they call it gaule
and hee anoynteth his fronte, and his breste therewith,
and they doe it great worship, and saye he shall be fulfilled
with the vertu of the Oxe before sayde, and that
he is halowed through vertue of that holy thinge as they
saye. And when the Kinge hath this done, then doe it
other lordes, and after them other men after theyr
degree, if they may haue any of the remenaunt.<a id="footnotetagcpliii14" name="footnotetagcpliii14"></a><a href="#footnotecpliii14"><sup>14</sup></a> In
thys countrey theyr ydoles are halfe men and halfe oxe,
as the figure sheweth in the seconde lefe here before, and
out of these ydolles the wycked ghost<a id="footnotetagcpliii15" name="footnotetagcpliii15"></a><a href="#footnotecpliii15"><sup>15</sup></a> speaketh unto
them, and giveth them aunswere of what thing that they
aske him, and before these ydolles they many times
sleay theyr children, and sprinkle the blood on the
ydoles, and so make they sacrifice. And if any man die
in that countrey, they brene them in tokening of penaunce
that he should suffer no penance if he were layd
in the earth for eating of wormes. And if his wife haue
no children then they burne hir with him, and they saye
that is good reason that she keepe him company in the
other worlde, as she dyd in this, &amp; if she haue children
she may liue with them and<a id="footnotetagcpliii16" name="footnotetagcpliii16"></a><a href="#footnotecpliii16"><sup>16</sup></a> she will; and if the wyfe

that hath wronge and holdeth the other still that hathe
righte, and therefore they come from farre countreys to
have Judgementes of causes that are in doubte. In this
church of Saint Thomas is a great image, y<sup>t</sup> is a simulacre,
&amp; it is richly beset with precious stons &amp; perles,
to that image men come in pilgrimage from farre countreys,
with great devocion, as Christen men go to Saint
James, &amp; there come some pilgrims y<sup>t</sup> beare sharp knives

theyr shankes &amp; thyghes, that the bloude may come out
for the love of that ydoll and they saye that he is holy
that will dye for that ydols sake. And there is some
that for the time that they go out of their houses at eche
third pace they knele till that they come to this idole.
And when they come there they have ensence<a id="footnotetagcpliiii6" name="footnotetagcpliiii6"></a><a href="#footnotecpliiii6"><sup>6</sup></a> or such
other thing for to ensence the ydole, as we would do to
Gods body. And there before that mynster or church of
this ydol, is a river full of water, &amp; in that river pilgrims
cast gold, silver, perles &amp; other precious stones without
number, in stede of offerings, and therefore, when y<sup>e</sup>
maister of the minster hath any neede of helping, as sone
they go the river &amp; take thereout as much as they haue
neede to helping of y<sup>e</sup> minster. And ye shall understande

there togither and then men set this Idoll with great
reverence &amp; worship in a chaire well dressed with cloth
of gold, and other tapistry, &amp; so they carry him with
great reverence &amp; worship, rounde about the citie, and
before the chaire goeth firste in procession all the maidens
of the countrey two &amp; two togither, &amp; so after them go
the pilgrimes that are come fro far countreys, of the which
pilgrims some fall downe before the chaire, &amp; letteth all
go over them and so are they slaine, and some haue
theyr armes broken &amp; leggs,<a id="footnotetagcpliiii7" name="footnotetagcpliiii7"></a><a href="#footnotecpliiii7"><sup>7</sup></a> and this they doe for love
of the Idol, and they beleve the more paine that they
suffer here for their Idol the more joy shall they haue in
y<sup>e</sup> other world, &amp; a man shall finde few Christen men
will suffer so much penaunce for our Lordes sake as
they do for the ydoll. And nighe before the chaire go

againe in his throne, and for worship of the ydoll two or
three<a id="footnotetagcpliiii8" name="footnotetagcpliiii8"></a><a href="#footnotecpliiii8"><sup>8</sup></a> are slaine with sharpe knives with their good will.
And also a man thinketh in our countrey that he hath a
great worshippe to haue an holy man in his kyn, lykewise
they saye that those that are there slayne are holye
men and sayntes &amp; they are wrytten in their letany, and
when they are thus dead theyr frendes brene theyr bodies

Pigmies, dwarfs. Homer, in the third book of the Iliad, has
immortalized the Pigmies and their battles with the Cranes. (See
<a href="#page275b">Appendix</a> for a curious engraving.) Pliny, in his 7th Book, cap. 2,
speaks thus of them: "Beyond these people, and at the very extremity
of the mountains, the Trispithami (<i>from</i> <ins title="Greek: treis">&tau;&rho;&epsilon;&#8150;&sigmaf;</ins>, <i>three, and</i>
<ins title="Greek: spithamai">&sigma;&pi;&iota;&theta;&alpha;&mu;&#8054;</ins>, <i>spans</i>), and the Pigmies are said to exist; two races that
are but three spans in height&mdash;that is to say, twenty-seven inches
only. They enjoy a salubrious atmosphere and a perpetual spring,
being sheltered by the mountains from the northern blasts: it is
these people that Homer has mentioned as being waged war upon
by cranes. It is said that they are in the habit of going down,
every spring, to the sea shore in a large body, seated on the backs
of rams and goats, and armed with arrows, and there destroy the
eggs and the young of those birds; that this expedition occupies
them for the space of three months, and that otherwise it would be
impossible for them to withstand the increasing multitudes of the
cranes. Their cabins, it is said, are built of mud, mixed with
feathers and egg-shells. Aristotle, indeed, says that they dwell in
caves; but, in other respects, he gives the same details as other
writers."</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N the province of Cathay towards the East, is an olde
citie &amp; beside that citie the Tartariens have made an
other citie that men call Cadon,<a id="footnotetagcplxvii1" name="footnotetagcplxvii1"></a><a href="#footnotecplxvii1"><sup>1</sup></a> y<sup>t</sup>
hathe xii<a id="footnotetagcplxvii2" name="footnotetagcplxvii2"></a><a href="#footnotecplxvii2"><sup>2</sup></a> gates, and
betwene eche two gates is a great myle, so those two
cities the olde and the new is round about xx myle. In
this citie is the palaice and sege of y<sup>e</sup> great Caane in a
full faire place and great, of which the wals about is two
myle, and within that are many fayre places, and in the
gardeyne of that palaice is a right greate hill on the
which is an other palaice, and it is the fayrest that may
bee founde in any place, and all about that hyll are many
trees berynge divers fruites, and about that hyll is a
great dyche, and there nere are many rivers on eche syde,
and in those are many wylde foules that he may take
and not go out of the palayce. Within y<sup>e</sup> hall of that
palaice are xxiiii pillers of gold and all the walks are
covered with rych skynnes of beastes that men call Panthera.</p>

<p>Those are fayre beastes and well smelling and of the
smell of those skynnes, none evyll smell may come to
the palayce, those skynnes are as redde as bloude, and
they shine so against the Sonne that a man can scarcely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>[pg 160]</span>
beholde them and those skynnes are estemed there as
much as golde.</p>

<p>In the myddest of the palace is a place made that
they call the Monture<a id="footnotetagcplxvii3" name="footnotetagcplxvii3"></a><a href="#footnotecplxvii3"><sup>3</sup></a> for the great Caane, that is well
made with precious stones and great hanging about, and
at the foure corners of that Montour are foure nedders<a id="footnotetagcplxvii4" name="footnotetagcplxvii4"></a><a href="#footnotecplxvii4"><sup>4</sup></a>
of golde, &amp; under that mountour and about are conduites
of bevrage that they drink in the Emperour's courte.
And the hall of that palayce is richly dight and wel, and
firste at the upper ende of the hall is the throne of the
Emperour right hie where he sitteth at meate (<i>at a</i>) table
that is well bordered with gold and that bordure is full
of precious stones and great pearles, and the greces on
which he goeth up are of diverse precious stones bordred
with golde.</p>

<p>At the left syde of his throne is the sege of his wife
a degree lower than he sitteth and that is of Jasper
bordred with gold and the sege of his seconde wife is a
degree lower than the fyrste, and that is also of good
Jasper bordred with golde and the sege of the thyrd wife
is a degree lower than the seconde for alwaye he hathe
three wives with him wheresoeuer he is, besyde these
wives on the same side setteth other ladies of his kin
eche one lower than other, as they are of degree, and all
those that are wedded, haue a counterfaite<a id="footnotetagcplxvii5" name="footnotetagcplxvii5"></a><a href="#footnotecplxvii5"><sup>5</sup></a> of a man's
foote uppon their heads a cubite long and all made with
precious stones, &amp; about they are made with shining
fethers of pecockes or such other in tokening that they
are in subjection to man &amp; under men's feete, &amp; they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>[pg 161]</span>
that are not wedded haue none such. On the right side
of the Emperour sitteth fyrste his sonne the which shall
be Emperour after him, and he sitteth also a degree
lower than the Emperour in such maner of seges as the
Emperour sitteth, and by him sitteth other lordes of his
kyn, eche one lower than other as they are of degree.
And the Emperour hath his table by himselfe alone that
is made of golde and precious stones, or of white Crystal
or yelowe, bordred with golde, and eche one of his wyves
hath a table by hirselfe. And under the Emperours
table sitteth foure clerkes at his feete that wryteth all
that the Emperour sayth be it good or ylle. And at
great feastes about the Emperours table, and all other
tables in the hall is a vine made of gold that goeth all
about the hall, and it hath many braunches of grapes
lyke to grapes of the vine, some are white, some are
yelowe, some red, some grene, and some blacke, all the
red are of rubies of cremes<a id="footnotetagcplxvii6" name="footnotetagcplxvii6"></a><a href="#footnotecplxvii6"><sup>6</sup></a> or allabonce, the white are
of cristall or byrall,<a id="footnotetagcplxvii7" name="footnotetagcplxvii7"></a><a href="#footnotecplxvii7"><sup>7</sup></a> the yelowe are of topaces, the grene
are of Emeraudes &amp; Crysolytes, and the blacke are of
Quickes and Gerandes, &amp; this vyne is made thus of
precious stones so properly that it seemeth that it were
a vyne growinge. And before the borde of the Emperour
standeth great lordes and no man is so hardy to
speke unto hym, except it be musicians for to solace the
Emperour. And all the vessell that is served in his hall
or chambres, are of precious stones and namely at tables
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>[pg 162]</span>
where great lordes eate, that is to say, of Jasper, crystall,
amatyst, or fyne golde, and the cuppes are of
Emeraudes, saphyres, topaces, and many other maner of
stones; and (<i>of</i>) silver haue they no vessell, for they
praise silver but little to make vessell of, but they make
of silver greces, pylers &amp; paviments of halles &amp; chambres.
And ye shall understande that my felaw &amp; I were in
wages with him xvi moneths against the Kinge of
Mancy,<a id="footnotetagcplxvii8" name="footnotetagcplxvii8"></a><a href="#footnotecplxvii8"><sup>8</sup></a> uppon whome he made warre, and the cause
was we had so great desire to see the nobilitye of his
court, if it were suche as we heard speake of, and
forsoth we founde it more richer &amp; solempne than ever
we harde speake of, and we should neuer haue beleved
it, had we not seene it. But ye shall understande the
meat and drinke is more honest among us than it is in
those countreys, for all the comons eate upon skines of
beastes on theyr knees and eate but fleshe of all maner
of beastes, &amp; when they haue all eate they wipe theyr
handes on their skirtes &amp; they eate but once in the day
&amp; eate but little bread but the maner of the lordes is
full noble and richly.</p>

<p class="title1"><i>Wherefore that the Emperour of Cathay is called the great

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>ND ye shall understande why he is called y<sup>e</sup> great
Caane, ye knowe y<sup>t</sup> all the worlde was destroied
with Noes floud but Noe his wife &amp; children. Noe had
three sons, Sem, Cham &amp; Japhet. Cham when he saw
his father naked when he slept, scorned him &amp; therefore
he was cursed and Japhet covered him againe. These
three brethrene hadde all the land. Cham toke the best
parte eastward that is called Asia. Sem toke Afryke
and Japhet toke Europe. Cham was the mightiest and
richest of his bretherne and of him are come the Paynim
folke &amp; divers maner of men of the yles, some headlesse,
and other men disfigured, and for this Cham the
Emperour there called him Cham and Lord of all. But
ye shall understande that the Emperour of Cathay is
called Caane, and not Cham, &amp; for this cause, it is not
long ago that all Tartary was in subjection and thrall to
other nations about, and they were made herdemen to
kepe beastes, and among them was vii linages<a id="footnotetagcplxviii1" name="footnotetagcplxviii1"></a><a href="#footnotecplxviii1"><sup>1</sup></a> or kindes,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>[pg 164]</span>
Cathay. Now it befell so that the first linage was an
olde man &amp; hee was not ryche and men called him
Chanius. This man lay and slept on a nighte in his
bedde, and there came to him a knighte, all white, sitting
uppon a white hors, and sayde to him, Caane slepeste
thou? God that is almighty sent me to thee, &amp; it is
his will that thou saye to the vii linages y<sup>t</sup> thou shalt be
theyr Emperour, for ye shall conquere all the lande about
you, and they shall be in your subjection as you have bene
in theirs. And when morow came he rose up and sayde it
to the vii linages, and they scorned him and sayde he
was a fole, and the next night the same knighte came to
the vii linages and bad them of gods behalfe to make
Chanius their Emperour, and they shold be out of all
subjection. And on the morow they chose Chanius to
be Emperour, and dyd him all worship that they might
do, &amp; called him Caane as the white knighte called him,
and they sayde they would doe as he badde them. Then
he made many statutes and lawes, the which he called
Ysakan.<a id="footnotetagcplxviii7" name="footnotetagcplxviii7"></a><a href="#footnotecplxviii7"><sup>7</sup></a> The firste statute was, that they shoulde be
obedient to God almyghtie, and beleve that he should
deliver them out of thraldome, and that they shoulde
call on him in all their workes. Another statute was, y<sup>t</sup>
all men that might beare armes shoulde be nombred, and
to eche x shoulde be a master, and to a hundred a master,
and to a thousand a master. Then he commaunded to
all the greatest and principallest of the vii linages, that
they should forsake all that they had in heritage or
lordship, and that they should hold them payed of that
he wold give them of his grace, and they did so. And
also he bad them y<sup>t</sup> eche man should bringe his eldest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>[pg 165]</span>
sonne before him, and sleay his owne sonne with his owne
handes, and smyte of their heads, and as sone they did
his bidding. And when he saw they made no letting<a id="footnotetagcplxviii8" name="footnotetagcplxviii8"></a><a href="#footnotecplxviii8"><sup>8</sup></a>

haue that byrde in great reverence, and for that cause
they worship that byrd aboue all other birds of the

uppon his enimies and destroyed them, and when he had
won all the landes that were aboute him, he helde them
in subjection. And when the Caane had won all the
lordes to mounte Belyan, the white knighte came to him
in a vision againe, and said unto him, Caan the will of
God is, that thou passe the mounte Belyan, and thou
shalt win many landes, and for thou shalt find no passage,
go thou to mount Belian that is upon the sea side and
knele ix times thereon against the east in the worship of
God, &amp; he shall shew thee a way how thou shalt passe,
and Caan did so, &amp; anon the sea that touched the hil,
withdrew him, &amp; shewed him a faire way of ix foote
brode betwene the hill and the sea, &amp; so he passed right
wel with al his men, &amp; then he wan the land of Cathay

to serve the Emperour &amp; all these barons haue crowns
of gold well dight with precious stones and pearles,
and they are clad in clothes of golde &amp; camathas<a id="footnotetagcplxxi1" name="footnotetagcplxxi1"></a><a href="#footnotecplxxi1"><sup>1</sup></a> as

thousande, and then the thirde thousande &amp; then the

before them, make peace, and then saye those men with
a loude voyce to all the hall, now be styll awhile, and
then saith one of the philosophers, eche man make

that all men shall laye their hande on their heads, and
they do so, and then he biddeth them take them away and
they doe so, and thus from houre to houre they bid divers

yron nayles passe, but it draweth them to him, and

in the ships, whereof those trees sprong and waxed.
And such roches are there many in diverse places of
that sea &amp; therefore dare there no shypman passe that

that was a noble prince, &amp; doughty, &amp; he had many
christen Knights with him and y<sup>e</sup> Emperour thought hee
woulde see the service in Christen churches, and then
was churches of christendome in Turkey, Surry and
Tartary, Hierusalem, Palistine, Araby and Alappy,<a id="footnotetagcpxcix2" name="footnotetagcpxcix2"></a><a href="#footnotecpxcix2"><sup>2</sup></a> and

all the lordes<a id="footnotetagcpxcix3" name="footnotetagcpxcix3"></a><a href="#footnotecpxcix3"><sup>3</sup></a> of Egypte. And thys Emperour came
with a Christen Knight into a church of Egipt and it
was on a saterday after Whit sonday when the byshop
gaue orders, and he behelde the service and he asked of
the Knight what folke those should be that stode before
the Byshop, and the Knight sayd they should be prestes,
&amp; he sayde he wold no more be called Kinge ne Emperour
but preest, and he would haue the name of him that
came first out of the prestes and he was called John,
and so haue all the Emperors sythen<a id="footnotetagcpxcix4" name="footnotetagcpxcix4"></a><a href="#footnotecpxcix4"><sup>4</sup></a> be called Prester
John. In this lande are many Christen men of good
faith &amp; good lawe, and they haue prestes to sing masse,
and they make the sacrements as men of Grece do, but
they say not but that y<sup>e</sup> Apostles said as saint Peter,
and saint Thomas, and other apostles when they song
masse and said <i>Pater noster</i>, and the wordes with the
which Gods body is sacred; we haue many addicions of
Popes that haue bene ordeyned of which men in those

<h3><i>Here beginneth the journall of Frier Odoricus, one of the
order of the Minorites, concerning strange things which
hee sawe among the Tartars of the East.</i></h3></div>

<div><img class="drop-cap" src="images/221-a-100.png" width="100" height="100" alt="A" /></div>
<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">ALBEIT</span>
many and sundry things are reported
by divers authors concerning the fashions
and conditions of this world: notwithstanding
I frier Odoricus of Friuli, de portu
Vahonis being desirous to travel unto the foreign and
remote nations of infidels, sawe and heard great and
miraculous things, which I am truly able to avouch.
First of al therefore sayling from Pera by Constantinople,
I arrived at Trapesunda.<a id="footnotetag1a1" name="footnotetag1a1"></a><a href="#footnote1a1"><sup>1</sup></a> This place is right
commodiously situate, as being an haven for the Persians
and Medes, and other countries beyonde the sea. In
this lande I behelde with very great delight a very strange
spectacle, namely a certain man leading about with him
more than foure thousande partriges. The man himselfe
walked upon the grounde, and the partriges flew in the
aire, which he ledde unto a certaine castle called Zavena,
being three days journey distant from Trapesunda.
The saide partriges were so tame, that when the man was
desirous to lie downe and rest, they would all come
flocking about him like chickens. And so hee led them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>[pg 222]</span>
unto Trapesunda, and unto the palace of the Emperour,
who tooke as many of them as he pleased, and the reste
the saide man carried unto the place from whence he
came. In this citie lyeth the body of Athanasius, upon
the gate of the citie. And then I passed on further unto
Armenia major, to a citie called Azaron,<a id="footnotetag1a2" name="footnotetag1a2"></a><a href="#footnote1a2"><sup>2</sup></a> which had
been very rich in olde time, but nowe the Tartars haue
almost layde it waste. In the saide citie there was
abundance of bread and flesh, and of all other victuals
except wine and fruits. This citie also is very colde,
and is reported to be higher situated, then any other city
in the world. It hath most holesome and sweete waters
about it: for the veines of the saide waters seeme to
spring and flow from the mighty river of Euphrates,
which is but a dayes journey from the saide city. Also,
the saide citie stands directly in the way to Tauris.<a id="footnotetag1a3" name="footnotetag1a3"></a><a href="#footnote1a3"><sup>3</sup></a>
And I passed on unto a certaine mountaine called
Sobissacalo. In the foresaide countrey there is the very
same mountaine whereupon the Arke of Noah rested;
unto the which I would willingly haue ascended, if my
company would haue stayed for me. Howbeit the
people of that countrey report, that no man could euer
ascend the saide mountaine, because (say they) it
pleaseth not the highest God. And I travailed on further
unto Tauris that great and royal city, which was in olde
time called Susis. This city is accompted for traffique
of merchandize the chiefe citie of the world: for there
is no kinde of victuals, nor any thing else belonging unto
merchandize, which is not to be had there in great abundance.
This citie stands very commodiously: for unto
it all the nations of the whole worlde in a maner may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223"></a>[pg 223]</span>
resort for traffique. Concerning the saide citie, the
Christians in those parts are of opinion, that the Persian
Emperour receives more tribute out of it, then the King
of France out of all his dominions. <i>Neare unto the saide
citie there is a salt-hill yeelding salt unto the city: and of
that salt ech man may take what pleaseth him, not paying
ought to any man therefor.</i> In this city many Christians
of all nations do inhabite, over whom the Saracens beare
rule in all things. Then I traveiled on further unto a
city called Soldania,<a id="footnotetag1a4" name="footnotetag1a4"></a><a href="#footnote1a4"><sup>4</sup></a> wherein the Persian Emperour
lieth all Sommer time: but in Winter hee takes his progresse
unto another city standing upon the sea called
Baku.<a id="footnotetag1a5" name="footnotetag1a5"></a><a href="#footnote1a5"><sup>5</sup></a> Also the foresaide city is very great and colde
having good and holesome waters therein, unto the
which also store of marchandize is brought. Moreover
I travelled with a certaine company of Caravans toward
upper India: and in the way, after many days journey,
I came unto the citie of the three wise men called
Cassan,<a id="footnotetag1a6" name="footnotetag1a6"></a><a href="#footnote1a6"><sup>6</sup></a> which is a noble and renowned city, saving that
the Tartars haue destroyed a great part thereof, and it
aboundeth in bread, wine, and many other commodities.
From this citie unto Jerusalem (whither the three foresaid
wisemen were miraculously led) it is fifty days
journey. There be many wonders in this citie also,
which for brevities sake, I omit. From thence I departed
unto a certain city called Geste, <i>whence the sea of
sand is distant one dayes journey, which is a most wonderful
and dangerous thing</i>. In this city there is abundance
of all kinds of victuals and especially of figs, raisins, and
grapes: more (as I suppose) then in any part of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224"></a>[pg 224]</span>
whole world besides. This is one of the three principall
cities of all the Persian Empire. Of this city the
Saracens report, that no Christian can by any means
live therein above a yeere. Then passing many dayes
journey on forward, I came unto a certain city called
Comum<a id="footnotetag1a7" name="footnotetag1a7"></a><a href="#footnote1a7"><sup>7</sup></a> which was a huge and mightie citie in olde
time, conteyning well nigh fiftie miles in circuite, and
hath done in times past great damage unto the Romanes.
In it there are stately palaces altogether destitute of inhabitants,
notwithstanding it aboundeth with great store
of victuals. From hence travailing through many
countreys, at length I came unto the land of Job called
Hus, which is full of all kinde of victuals and very pleasantly
situated. Thereabouts are certaine mountaines
having good pastures for cattell upon them. Here also
Manna is found in great aboundance. Four partriges
are here solde for lesse than a groat. In this countrey
there are most comely olde men. Here also the men
spin and card, and not the women. This land bordereth
upon the North part of Chaldea.</p>

<h3><i>Of the maners of the Chaldeans, and of India.</i><a name="page224a" id="page224a"></a></h3>
</div>
<p><span class="dropcap">F</span>ROM thence I traveled into Chald&aelig;a, which is a
great kingdome and I passed by the tower of
Babel. This region hath a language peculiar unto
itselfe, and there are beautiful men and deformed
women. <i>The men of the same countrey used to haue their
haire kempt, and trimmed like unto our women: and they</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>[pg 225]</span>
<i>weare golden turbants upon their heads richly set with
pearle, and pretious stones. The women are clad in a
course smock onely reaching to their knees and having long
sleeves hanging downe to the ground.</i> And they goe barefooted,
wearing breeches which reach to the ground also.
They weare no attire upon their heads, but their haire
hangs disheaveled about their eares: and there be many
other strange things also. From thence I came into the
lower India, which the Tartars overran &amp; wasted. And
in this countrey the people eat dates for the most part,
whereof 42 li are there sold for lesse than a groat. I
passed further also many dayes journey unto the Ocean
Sea &amp; the first lande where I arrived, is called Ormes,<a id="footnotetag2a1" name="footnotetag2a1"></a><a href="#footnote2a1"><sup>1</sup></a>
being well fortified, and having great store of merchandize
and treasure therein. Here also they use a kinde
of Bark or shippe called Jase, being compact together
onely with hempe. And I went on board into one of
them, wherein I could not finde any yron at all, and in
the space of 28 days I arrived at the city of Thana,<a id="footnotetag2a2" name="footnotetag2a2"></a><a href="#footnote2a2"><sup>2</sup></a>
wherein foure of our friers were martyred for the faith
of Christ. This countrey is well situate having abundance
of bread and wine, and of other victuals therein.
This Kingdome in olde time was very large and under the
dominion of King Porus, who fought a great battell with
Alexander the great. The people of this countrey are
idolaters worshipping fire, serpents and trees. And ouer
all this land the Saracens do beare rule, who tooke it by
maine force, and they themselues are in subjection unto
King Daldilus. There be divers kinds of beasts, as
namely blacke lyons in great abundance, and apes also,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>[pg 226]</span>
and monkeis, and battes as bigge as our doves. And
there are mise as bigge as our countrey dogs, and therefore
they are hunted with dogs, because cats are not
able to encounter them. Moreouer in the same countrey
every man hath a bundle of great boughs standing in a
water-pot before his doore, which bundle is as great as a
pillar, and it will not wither, so long as water is applied
thereunto: with many other novelties and strange things,
the relation whereof would breed great delight.</p>

<h3><i>How peper is had: and where it groweth.</i><a name="page226a" id="page226a"></a></h3>
</div>
<p><span class="dropcap">M</span>OREOUER, that it may be manifest how peper
is had, it is to be understood that it groweth in a
certaine kingdome whereat I myself arrived, being called
Minibar,<a id="footnotetag3a1" name="footnotetag3a1"></a><a href="#footnote3a1"><sup>1</sup></a> and it is not so plentifull in any other part of
the worlde as it is there. For the wood wherein it
growes conteineth in circuit 18 dayes journey. And in
the said wood or forrest there are two cities one called
Flandrina,<a id="footnotetag3a2" name="footnotetag3a2"></a><a href="#footnote3a2"><sup>2</sup></a> and the other Cyncilim. In Flandrina both
Jewes &amp; Christians doe inhabite, betweene whom there
is often contention and warre: howbeit the Christians
overcome the Jewes at all times. In the foresaid wood
pepper is had after this maner: first it groweth in leaves
like unto pot-hearbes, which they plant neere unto great
trees as we do our vines, and they bring forth pepper in
clusters, as our vines doe yeeld grapes, but being ripe,
they are of a green colour, and are gathered as we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>[pg 227]</span>
gather grapes, and then the graines are layd in the
Sunne to be dried, and being dried are put into earthen
vessels: and thus is pepper made and kept. Now, in
the same wood there be many rivers, wherein are great
store of Crocodiles, and of other serpents, which the inhabitants
of that countrey do burne up with strawe and
with other dry fewel, and so they go to gather their
pepper without danger. At the South End of the said
forrest stands the city of Polumbrum,<a id="footnotetag3a3" name="footnotetag3a3"></a><a href="#footnote3a3"><sup>3</sup></a> which aboundeth
with marchandize of all kinds. All the inhabitants of
that countrey do worship a living oxe, as their god, whom
they put to labour for sixe yeres, and in the seventh yere
they cause him to rest from al his worke, placing him in
a solemne and publique place: and calling him an holy
beast. <i>Moreouer they use this foolish ceremonie: Every
morning they take two basons, either of silver or of gold,
and with one they receive the urine of the oxe, and with the
other his dung. With the urine they wash their face, their
eyes, and all their fiue senses. Of the dung they put into
both their eyes, then they anoint the bals of their cheeks
therewith, and thirdly their breast: and then they say that
they are sanctified for all that day: And as the people
doe, euen so doe their king and Queene.</i> This people worshippeth
also a dead idole which from the navel upward,
resembleth a man, and from the navel downward an oxe.
The very same Idol delivers oracles unto them, and
sometimes requireth the blood of fourtie virgins for his
hire. And therefore the men of that region do consecrate
their daughters and their sonnes unto their idols,
euen as Christians do their children unto some Religion
or Saint in heaven. Likewise they sacrifice their sonnes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>[pg 228]</span>
and their daughters, and so, much people is put to death
before the said Idol by reason of that accursed ceremony.
Also, many other hainous and abominable villainies
doeth that brutish beastly people commit: and I
saw many more strange things among them which I
meane not here to insert. Another most vile custome
the foresaide nation doeth retaine: <i>for when any man
dieth they burne his dead corpse to ashes: and if his wife
surviveth him, her they burne quicke, because (say they) she
shall accompany her husband in his tilthe and husbandry,
when he is come unto a new worlde. Howbeit the said
wife having children by her husband, may if she will, remaine
still alive with them, without shame or reproche:
notwithstanding, for the most part, they all of them make
choice to be burnt with their husbands.</i> Now, albeit the
wife dieth before her husband, that law bindeth not the
husband to any such inconvenience but he may marry
another wife also. <i>Likewise, ye said nation hath another
strange custome, in that their women drink wine, but their
men do not. Also the women haue the lids &amp; brows of their
eyes &amp; beards shaven, but the men haue not</i>: with many
other base and filthie fashions which the said women
do use contrary to the nature of their sexe. From that
kingdome I traveiled 10 daies journey unto another
kingdome called Mobar,<a id="footnotetag3a4" name="footnotetag3a4"></a><a href="#footnote3a4"><sup>4</sup></a> which containeth many cities.
Within a certaine church of the same countrey, the
body of S. Thomas the Apostle is interred, the very
same church being full of idols: and in 15 houses round
about the said Church there dwell certaine priests who
are Nestorians, that is to say, false, and bad Christians
and schismatiques.</p>

<h3><i>Of a strange and uncouth idole: &amp; of certaine customes and ceremonies.</i></h3>
</div>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N the kingdome of Mobar there is a wonderfull
strange idole, being made after the shape and resemblance
of a man, as big as the image of our Christopher,
&amp; consisting all of most pure and glittering gold. And
about the necke thereof hangeth a silke riband, ful of
most rich &amp; precious stones, some one of which is of
more value than a whole kingdome. The house of this
idol is all of beaten gold, namely the roofe, the pavement,
and the sieling of the wall within and without.
Unto this idol the Indians go on pilgrimage, as we do
unto St. Peter. Some go with halters about their necks,
some with their hands bound behind them, some with
knives sticking on their armes or legs: and if after their
peregrination, the flesh of their wounded arme festereth
or corrupteth, they esteeme that limme to be holy, &amp;
thinke that their God is wel pleased with them. <i>Neare
unto the temple of that idol is a lake made by men in an
open and common place, whereinto the pilgrimes cast gold,
silver and precious stones, for the honour of the idol and the
repairing of his temple. And therefore when anything is
to be adorned or mended, they go unto this lake taking up
the treasure which was cast in. Moreouer at euery yerely
feast of the making or repairing of the said idol, the king
and queene, with the whole multitude of the people, &amp; all
the pilgrimes assemble themselues, &amp; placing the said idol
in a most stately &amp; rich chariot, they cary him out of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id="page230"></a>[pg 230]</span>
temple with songs, &amp; with all kinds of musical harmonie,
and a great companie of virgins go procession-wise two and
two in a rank singing before him. Many pilgrims also put
themselves under the chariot wheeles, to the end that their
false god may go ouer them, and al they ouer whom the
chariot runneth, are crushed in pieces, &amp; divided asunder
in the midst, and slaine right out. Yea, &amp; in doing this,
they think themselves to die most holily &amp; securely, in the
service of their god.</i> And by this meanes every yere,
there die under the said filthy idol, mo then 500 persons,
whose carcases are burned, and their ashes are kept for
reliques, because they died in that sort for their god.
Moreover they haue another detestable ceremony. For
when any man offers to die in the service of his false god,
his parents &amp; all his friends assemble themselues together
with a consort of musicians, making him a great &amp;
solemne feast: which feast being ended, they hang 5
sharpe knifes about his neck carrying him before the idol
&amp; so soone as he is come thither, he taketh one of his
knives crying with a loud voice, For the worship of my
god do I cut this my flesh, and then he casteth the morsel
which is cut, at y<sup>e</sup> face of his idol: but at the very
last wound wherewith he murthereth himselfe, he uttereth
these words: "Now do I yeeld myself to death in the
behalfe of my god" and being dead his body is burned,
&amp; is esteemed by al men to be holy. The king of the
said region is most rich in silver, gold, and precious
stones, &amp; there be the fairest unions in al the world.</p>

<p>Traveling from thence by the Ocean sea 50 daies
journey southward, I came unto a certaine land named
Lammori,<a id="footnotetag4a1" name="footnotetag4a1"></a><a href="#footnote4a1"><sup>1</sup></a> where, <i>in regard of extreeme heat, the people</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page231" id="page231"></a>[pg 231]</span>
<i>both men and women go stark-naked from top to toe: who
seeing me apparelled, scoffed at me, saying that God made
Adam and Eve naked. In this countrey al women are
common, so that no man can say, this is my wife. Also when
any of the said women beareth a son or a daughter, she
bestowes it upon anyone that hath lien with her, whom she
pleaseth. Likewise al the land of that region is possessed
in common, so that there is not mine &amp; thine, or any propriety
of possession in the division of lands: howbeit euery
man hath his owne house peculiar unto himselfe.</i> Mans
flesh, if it be fat, is eaten as ordinarily there as beefe in
our countrey. And albeit the people are most lewd, yet
the countrey is exceeding good, abounding with al commodities,
as fleshe, corne, rise, silver, gold, wood of aloes,
Camphir, and many other things. Marchants coming
unto this region for traffique do usually bring with them
fat men, selling them unto the inhabitants as we sel hogs,
who immediately kil and eat them. In this island
towards the south, there is another kingdome called
Simoltra,<a id="footnotetag4a2" name="footnotetag4a2"></a><a href="#footnote4a2"><sup>2</sup></a> where both men and women marke themselves
with red-hot yron in 12 sundry spots of their faces: and
this nation is at continual warre with certaine naked
people in another region. Then I traveled further unto
another island called Java, the compasse whereof by sea
is 3000 miles. The king of this Iland hath 7 other
crowned kings under his jurisdiction. The said Island
is throughly inhabited &amp; is thought to be one of the
principall Ilands of y<sup>e</sup> whole world. In the same Iland

The king of the said Iland of Java hath a brave and
sumptuous pallace, the most loftily built, that euer I saw
any, &amp; it hath most high greeses<a id="footnotetag4a3" name="footnotetag4a3"></a><a href="#footnote4a3"><sup>3</sup></a> and stayers to ascend
up into the roomes therein contained, one stayre being
of silver, &amp; another of gold, throughout the whole building.
Also the lower roomes were paved all ouer with one
square plate of silver, &amp; another of gold. All the walls
upon the inner side were seeled ouer with plates of gold,
wherupon were ingraven y<sup>e</sup> pictures of knights, having
about their temples, ech of them a wreath of golde,
adorned with precious stones. The roofe of the palace
was of pure gold. With this King of Java the great
Can of Catay hath had many conflicts in war; whom
notwithstanding the said king hath always overcome
and vanquished.</p>

<h3><i>Of certaine trees yeelding meale, honey, and poyson.</i><a name="page232a" id="page232a"></a></h3>
</div>
<p><span class="dropcap">N</span>EERE unto the said Iland is another countrey
called Panten, or Tathalamasin.<a id="footnotetag5a1" name="footnotetag5a1"></a><a href="#footnote5a1"><sup>1</sup></a> And the king
of the same countrey hath many Ilands under his dominion.
In this land there are trees yeelding meale, hony,
&amp; wine &amp; the most deadly poison in all y<sup>e</sup> whole world:
for against it there is but one only remedy: &amp; that is
this: if any man hath taken of y<sup>e</sup> poyson, &amp; would be
delivered from the danger thereof, let him temper the
dung of a man in water, &amp; so drinke a good quantitie
thereof, &amp; it expels the poyson immediatly, making it
to avoid at the fundament. Meale is produced out of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id="page233"></a>[pg 233]</span>
the said trees after this maner. They be mighty huge
trees and when they are cut with an axe by the ground,
there issueth out of the stock a certain licour like unto
gumme, which they take and put into bags made of
leaues, laying them for 15 days together abroad in
the sunne, &amp; at the end of those 15 dayes, when the
said licour is throughly parched, it becometh meale.
Then they steepe it first in sea water, washing it afterward
with fresh water, and so it is made very good &amp;
savorie paste, whereof they make either meat or bread,
as they thinke good. Of which bread I my selfe did
eate, &amp; it is fayrer without &amp; somewhat browne within.
By this countrey is the sea called Mare mortuum, which
runneth continually Southward, into y<sup>e</sup> which whosoever
falleth in (<i>is</i>) never seene after. In this countrey also are
found canes of an incredible length, namely of 60
paces high or more, &amp; they are as bigge as trees. Other
canes there be also called Cassan,<a id="footnotetag5a2" name="footnotetag5a2"></a><a href="#footnote5a2"><sup>2</sup></a> which overspread the
earth like grasse, &amp; out of euery knot of them spring
foorth certaine branches, which are continued upon the
ground almost for the space of a mile. In the said canes
there are found certaine stones, one of which stones, whosoever
carryeth about with him, cannot be wounded with
any yron: &amp; therefore the men of that countrey for the
most part, carry such stones with them, whithersoever
they goe. Many also cause one of the armes of their
children, while they are yong, to be launced, putting one
of the said stones into the wound, healing also, and
closing up the said wound with the powder of a certaine
fish (the name whereof I do not know) which powder
doth immediatly consolidate and cure the said wounde.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page234" id="page234"></a>[pg 234]</span>
And by the virtue of these stones the people aforesaid
doe for the most part triumph both on sea and land.
Howbeit there is one kinde of stratageme, which the
enemies of this nation, knowing the vertue of the sayd
stones, doe practise against them: namely, they provide
themselues armour of yron or steele against their arrowes,
&amp; weapons also poisoned with the poyson of trees &amp;
they carry in their hands wooden stakes most sharpe and
hard pointed, as if they were yron: likewise they shoot
arrowes without yron heads, &amp; so they confound and
slay some of their unarmed foes trusting too securely
unto the vertue of their stones. Also of the foresayd
canes called Cassan they make sayles for their ships, and
litel houses, and many other necessaries. From thence
after many dayes travell, I arrived at another kingdome
called Campa, a most beautiful and rich countrey, &amp;
abounding with all kind of victuals: the king whereof,
at my being there, had so many wives &amp; concubines, that
he had 300 sonnes &amp; daughters by them. This king
hath 10004 tame Elephants, which are kept even as we
keepe droves of oxen or flocks of sheepe in pasture.</p>

<h3><i>Of the abundance of fishes, which cast themselues upon the
shore.</i><a name="page234a" id="page234a"></a></h3>
</div>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N this countrey there is one strange thing to be observed,
y<sup>t</sup> euery several kind of fishes in those seas
come swimming towards the said countrey in such abundance,
that, for a great distance into the sea, nothing can
be seene but the backes of fishes: <i>which casting themselues
upon the shore when they come neere unto it, do suffer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id="page235"></a>[pg 235]</span>
men, for the space of 3 daies to come &amp; take as many of
them as they please, &amp; then they return again to the sea.
After that kind of fishes comes another kind, offering itselfe
after the same maner, &amp; so in like sort all other kinds
whatsoever: notwithstanding they do this but once in a
year. And I demaunded of the inhabitants there how, or
by what meanes this strange accident could come to passe:
They answered, that fishes were taught, even by nature to
come and do homage unto their Emperour.</i> There be Tortoises
also as bigge as an oven. Many other things I
saw which are incredible, unlesse a man should see them
with his own eies. In this countrey also dead men are
burned, &amp; their wives are burned aliue with them, as
in the city of Polumbrum aboue mentioned: for the men
of that countrey say that she goeth to accompany him
in another world, that he should take none other wife in
mariage. Moreouer I traveled on further by the ocean-sea
towards the South, &amp; passed through many countries
and islands, whereof one is called Moumoran, &amp; it containeth
in compasse ii. M miles, wherein men &amp; women
haue dogs faces, and worship an oxe for their god: and
therefore euery one of them cary the image of an oxe
of gold or silver upon their foreheads. The men &amp;
women of this country go all naked, saving that they
hang a linen cloth round their loins. The men of the
said country are very tall and mighty, and by reason
that they goe naked, when they are to make battell,
they cary yron or steele-targets before them, which do
cover and defend their bodies from top to toe: and
whomsoever of their foes they take in battel not being
able to ransome himselfe for money, they presently devoure
him: but if he be able to redeeme himselfe for
money, they let him go free. Their king weareth about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>[pg 236]</span>
his necke 300 great &amp; most beautiful unions,<a id="footnotetag6a1" name="footnotetag6a1"></a><a href="#footnote6a1"><sup>1</sup></a> and saith
euery day 300 prayers unto his god. He weareth upon
his finger also a stone of a span long, which seemeth to
be a flame of fire, and therefore when he weareth it, no
man dare approach unto him: and they say that there is
not any stone in the whole world of more value than it.
Neither could at any time the great Tartarian Emperour
of Katay either by force, money, or policie obtain it at
his hands, notwithstanding that he hath done the utmost
of his indeavour for this purpose.</p>

<h3><i>Of the Island of Sylan: and of the mountaine where Adam
mourned for his sonne Abel.</i><a name="page236a" id="page236a"></a></h3>
</div>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;PASSED by also another island called Sylan,<a id="footnotetag7a1" name="footnotetag7a1"></a><a href="#footnote7a1"><sup>1</sup></a> which
conteineth in compasse aboue ii M miles, wherin
are an infinit number of serpents, &amp; great store of lions,
beares, &amp; al kinds of ravening &amp; wild beasts, and especially
of elephants. In the said countrey there is an
huge mountaine, whereupon the inhabitants of that
region do report that Adam mourned for his son Abel y<sup>e</sup>
space of 500 yeres. In the midst of this mountaine
there is a most beautiful plain, wherin is a litle lake conteining
great plenty of water, which water y<sup>e</sup> inhabitants
report to haue proceeded from the teares of Adam &amp;
Eve: howbeit I proved that to be false, because I saw
the water flow in the lake. This water is ful of hors-leeches,
&amp; blood suckers, &amp; of precious stones also, which
precious stones the king taketh not unto his owne use,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page237" id="page237"></a>[pg 237]</span>
but once or twise euery yere he permitteth certaine
poore people to diue under water for ye said stones

with less danger dive under water, they take limons<a id="footnotetag7a2" name="footnotetag7a2"></a><a href="#footnote7a2"><sup>2</sup></a>
which they pil,<a id="footnotetag7a3" name="footnotetag7a3"></a><a href="#footnote7a3"><sup>3</sup></a> anointing themselves with the juice
thereof, &amp; so they may diue naked under y<sup>e</sup> water, the
hors-leeches not being able to hurt them. From this
lake the water runneth even unto the sea, and at a low
ebbe the inhabitants dig rubies, diamonds &amp; perles, and
other precious stones out of the shore: wherupon it is
thought, that ye king of this island hath greater abundance
of pretious stones, then any other monarch in the
whole earth besides. In the said countrey there be all
kinds of beastes and foules: &amp; the people told me, that
those beasts would not invade nor hurt any stranger but
only the natural inhabitants.</p>

<p><i>I saw in this island fouls as big as our countrey geese,
having two heads, and other miraculous things, which I
will not here write off. Traveling on further South, I
arrived at a certaine island called Bodin,</i><a id="footnotetag7a4" name="footnotetag7a4"></a><a href="#footnote7a4"><sup>4</sup></a> <i>which signifieth
in our language unclean. In this island there do inhabit

the son his father, the husband his owne wife &amp; the wife
her husband: &amp; that after this maner. If any mans
father be sick, the son straight goes unto the sooth-saying or
prognosticating priest, requesting him to demand of his
god, whether his father shall recover from his infirmity or
no; Then both of them go unto an idol of gold or silver,</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page238" id="page238"></a>[pg 238]</span>
<i>making their prayers unto it in maner folowing: Lord,
thou art our god, &amp; thee we do adore, beseeching thee to
resolve us, whether such a man must die, or recover of such
an infirmity or no: Then the divel answereth out of y<sup>e</sup>
aforesaide idol: if he saieth (he shal liue) then returneth
his son and ministreth things necessary unto him til he
hath attained unto his former health: but if he saith (he
shall die) then goes y<sup>e</sup> priest unto him, &amp; putting a cloth
into his mouth doth strangle him therewith: which being
done, he cuts his dead body into morsels, &amp; al his friends
and kinsfolk are invited unto the eating thereof, with
musique &amp; all kinde of mirth: howbeit his bones are
solemnely buried.</i> And when I found fault with that
custome demanding a reason thereof, one of them gaue
me this answere; this we doe lest the wormes should eat
his flesh, for then his soule should suffer great torments,
neither could I by any meanes remoove them from that
errour. Many other novelties and strange things there
bee in this countrey, which no man would credite, unles
he saw them with his owne eyes. Howbeit, I (before
almighty God) do here make relation of nothing but of
that onely, whereof I am as sure, as a man may be sure.
Concerning the foresaid islands, I enquired of divers wel-experienced
persons, who al of them, as it were with one
consent, answered me saying, that this India contained
4400 islands under it, or within it, in which islands there
are sixty and foure crowned kings: and they say moreouer,
that the greater part of those islands are wel inhabited.

India.</p>

<h3><i>Of the upper India: and of the province of Mancy.</i><a id="footnotetag8a1" name="footnotetag8a1"></a><a href="#footnote8a1"><sup>1</sup></a></h3>
</div>
<p><span class="dropcap">F</span>IRST of al therefore, having traveled many dayes
journey upon the Ocean-sea towards the East, at
length I arrived at a certaine great province called
Mancy, being in Latine named India. Concerning this
India I inquired of Christians, of Saracens, &amp; of Idolaters,
and of al such as bare an office under the great
Can; who all of them with one consent answered, that
this province of Mancy hath mo then 2000 great cities
within the precincts thereof &amp; that it aboundeth with
all plenty of victuals, as namely with bread, wine, rise,
flesh, and fish. All the men of this province be artificers
&amp; marchants, who, though they be in never so extreme
penurie, so long as they can help themselues by the
labor of their handes, will neuer beg almes of any man.
The men of this province are of a faire and comely personage,
but somewhat pale, having their heads shaven
but a little, but the women are the most beautiful under
the sunne. The first city of the said India which I
came unto, is called Ceuskalon, which being a daies
journey distant from the sea, stands upon a river, the
water whereof, nere unto the mouth, where it exonerateth
it selfe into the sea, doth overflow the land for
the space of 12 daies journey. All the inhabitants of
this India are worshippers of idols. The foresaid city
of Ceuskalon hath such an huge navy belonging thereunto,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id="page240"></a>[pg 240]</span>
that no man would beleeve it unlesse he should see
it. In this city I saw 300 li of good and new ginger
sold for lesse than a groat. There are the greatest, and
the fairest geese, &amp; most plenty of them to be sold in
al the world, as I suppose: they are as white as milke,
&amp; haue a bone upon the crowne of their heads, as bigge
as an egge, being of the colour of blood: under the
throat they haue a skin or bag hanging down halfe a
foot. They are exceeding fat and wel sold. Also they
haue ducks and hens in that countrey, one as big as two
of ours. There be monstrous great serpents likewise,
which are taken by the inhabitants &amp; eaten; whereupon
a solemne feast among them without serpents is not
set by.</p>

<p>And to be briefe, in this city there are al kinds of
victuals in great abundance. From thence I passed by
many cities &amp; at length I came unto a citie named
Caitan,<a id="footnotetag8a2" name="footnotetag8a2"></a><a href="#footnote8a2"><sup>2</sup></a> wherein ye friers Minorites haue two places of
abode, unto which I transported the bones of the dead
friers, which suffered martyrdom for the faith of Christ,
as it is aboue mentioned. In this citie there is abundance
of al kind of victuals very cheap. The said city
is as big as two of Bononia,<a id="footnotetag8a3" name="footnotetag8a3"></a><a href="#footnote8a3"><sup>3</sup></a> &amp; in it are many monasteries
of religious persons, al which do worship idols.</p>

<p>I myselfe was in one of those monasteries, &amp; it was
told me, that there were in it <span class="sc">III M</span> religious men, having
<span class="sc">XI M</span> idols; and one of y<sup>e</sup> said idols which seemed unto
me but litle in regard of the rest, was as big as our
Christopher. These religious men euery day do feed
their idol-gods: wherupon at a certaine time I went to
behold the banquet: and indeed those things which they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id="page241"></a>[pg 241]</span>
brought unto them were good to eate, &amp; fuming hote
insomuch that the steam of the smoke thereof ascended
up unto their idols, and they said that their gods were
refreshed with the smoke: howbeit all the meat they
conveyed away, eating it up their owne selves, and so
they fed their dumb gods with the smoke only.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>RAVELING more eastward, I came unto a city
named Fuco,<a id="footnotetag9a1" name="footnotetag9a1"></a><a href="#footnote9a1"><sup>1</sup></a> which containeth 30 miles in circuit,
wherein be exceeding great &amp; faire cocks, <i>and al their
hens are as white as the very snow, having wool in stead of
feathers, like unto sheep</i>. It is a most stately &amp; beautiful
city &amp; standeth up the sea. Then I went 18 daies
journey on further, &amp; passed by many provinces &amp; cities,
and in the way I went over a certain great mountaine,
upon ye one side whereof I beheld al living creatures to
be as black as a cole, &amp; the men and women on that
side differed somewhat in maner of living from others;
howbeit, on the other side of the said hil every living
thing was snow-white &amp; the inhabitants in their maner
of living, were altogether unlike unto others. There, al
maried women cary in token that they haue husbands, a
great trunk of horne upon their heads. From thence I
traveled 18 dayes journey further and came unto a certaine
great river, and entered also into a city, whereunto
belongeth a mighty bridge to passe the said river. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>[pg 242]</span>
mine hoste with whom I sojourned, being desirous to
show me some sport, said unto me, Sir, if you will see
any fish taken, goe with me. Then hee led me unto the
foresaid bridge, carrying in his armes certain dive-doppers<a id="footnotetag9a2" name="footnotetag9a2"></a><a href="#footnote9a2"><sup>2</sup></a>
or water-foules, bound unto a company of poles, and
about every one of their necks he tied a thread, lest they
should eat the fish as fast as they took them: and he
carried three great baskets with him also; then loosed
he the dive-doppers from the poles, which presently went
into the water, &amp; within lesse then the space of one
houre, caught as many fishes as filled the 3 baskets:
which being full, mine hoste untied the threeds from
about their neckes, and entering a second time into the
river they fed themselves with fish, and being satisfied
they returned and suffered themselves to be bound unto
the said poles as they were before. And when I did
eate of those fishes, we thought they were exceeding
good. Travailing thence many dayes journeys, at length
I arrived at another city called Canasia,<a id="footnotetag9a3" name="footnotetag9a3"></a><a href="#footnote9a3"><sup>3</sup></a> which signifieth
in our language, the city of heaven. Never in all my
life did I see so great a city: for it containeth in circuit
an hundreth miles; neither sawe I any plot thereof,
which was not throughly inhabited: yea, I sawe many
houses of tenne or twelve stories high, one aboue the
other. It hath mightie large suburbs containing more
people then the citie it selfe. Also it hath twelue principall
gates: and about the distance of 8 miles, in the
high way unto euery one of the saide gates standeth a
city as big by estimation as Venice, and Padua. The
aforesaide city of Canasia is situated in waters or
marshes, which always stand still, neither ebbing nor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page243" id="page243"></a>[pg 243]</span>
flowing: howbeit it hath a defence for the winde like
unto Venice. In this citie there are mo than 10002
bridges, many whereof I numbered and passed over
them: and upon every of those bridges stand certaine
watchmen of the citie, keeping continuall ward and
watch about the saide citie, the great Can the Emperour
of Catay. The people of this countrey say, that they
haue one duetie injoyned unto them by their lord: for
euery fire payeth one Balis in regard of tribute: and a
Balis is five papers or pieces of silk, which are worth one
floren and an halfe of our coine. Tenne or twelue housholds
are accompted for one fire, and so pay tribute but
for one fire only. Al those tributary fires amount unto
the number of 85 Thuman, with other foure Thuman of
the Saracens, which make 89 in al: And one Thuman
consisteth of 10000 fires. The residue of the people of
the city are some of them Christians, some marchants,
and some traveilers through the countrey. Whereupon
I marveiled much how such an infinite number of persons
could inhabite and liue together. There is great
aboundance of victuals in this city, as namely of bread
and wine, and especially of hogs-flesh with other necessaries.</p>

whose house I continually abode, for so long time as I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page244" id="page244"></a>[pg 244]</span>
remained in the citie, Who upon a certain time said unto
me: Ara, that is to say, Father, will you go and behoulde
the citie? And I said, yea. Then embarked we ourselves,
and directed our course unto a certaine great
Monastery: where being arrived, he called a religious
person with whom he was acquainted, saying unto him
concerning me: this Raban Francus, that is to say, this
religious Frenchman commeth from the Westerne parts
of the world and therefore you must show him some rare
things, that when he returnes into his owne countrey, he
may say, this strange sight or novelty haue I seene in
the citie of Canasia. Then the said religious man tooke
two greate baskets full of broken reliques which remained
of the table, &amp; led me unto a little walled parke, the
doore whereof he unlocked with his key, and there appeared
unto us a pleasant faire green plot, into the which
we entred. In the said greene stands a litle mount in

fine shady trees. And while we stood there, he tooke a
cymbal or bell, and rang therewith, as they used to ring
to dinner or bevoir in cloisters, at the sound whereof
many creatures of divers kindes came downe from the
mount, some like apes, some like cats, some like monkeys,
and some having faces like men. And while I
stood beholding of them, they gathered themselves
together about him, to the number of 4200 of those
creatures, putting themselues in good order, before whom
he set a platter, and gaue them the saide fragments to
eate. And when they had eaten he rang upon his cymbal
the second time, and they all returned unto their
former places. Then, wondring greatly at the matter, I
demanded what kind of creatures those might be? They
are (quoth he) the Soules of noble men which we do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id="page245"></a>[pg 245]</span>
here feed, for the love of God who governeth the world:
and as a man was honorable or noble in this life, so his
soule after death, entreth into the body of some excellent
beast or other, but the soules of simple and rusticall
people do possesse the bodies of more vile and brutish
creatures. Then I began to refute that foule error:
howbeit my speech did nothing at all to prevaile with
him, for hee could not be perswaded that any soule
might remaine without a body. From thence I departed
unto a certaine citie named Chilenso, the walls whereof
contained 40 miles in circuit. In this citie there are 360
bridges of stone, the fairest that euer I saw, and it is
wel inhabited, having a great navie belonging thereunto,
&amp; abounding with all kinds of victuals and other commodities.
And thence I went unto a certaine river called
Thalay which where it is most narrow, is 7 miles broad:
and it runneth through the midst of the land of the
Pygm&oelig;i whose chiefe city is called Cakam, and is one
of the goodliest cities in the world. These Pygm&oelig;ans
are three of my spans high, and they make larger and
better cloth of cotton and silke, then any other nation
under the sunne. And coasting along by the said river,
I came unto a certaine city named Janzu, in which citie
there is one receptacle for the Friers of our order, and
there be also three Churches of the Nestorians. This
Janzu is a noble and great citie, containing 48 Thumans
of tributarie fires, and in it are all kindes of victuals, and
great plenty of such beastes, foules, and fishes, as Christians
doe usually liue upon. The lord of the same citie
hath in yeerely revenues for salt onely, fiftie Thuman of
Balis, &amp; one balis is worth a floren and a halfe of our
coyne: insomuch that one Thuman of balis amounteth
unto the value of 15000 florens. Howbeit the sayd lord,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>[pg 246]</span>
favoureth his people in one respect, for sometimes he forgiveth
them frely 200 Thuman, lest there should be any
scarcity or dearth among them. There is a custome in
this citie, that when any man is determined to banquet
his friends, going about unto certaine tavernes or cookes
houses appointed for the same purpose, he sayth unto
euery particular hoste, you shall haue such and such of
my friends, whom you must entertain in my name, and
so much I will bestowe upon the banquet. And by that
means his friendes are better feasted at diverse places,
then they should haue beene at one. Tenne miles from
the sayde citie, about the head of the foresayd river of
Thalay, there is a certaine other citie called Montu,
which hath the greatest navy that I saw in the whole
world. All their ships are as white as snow, &amp; they
haue banquetting houses in them, and many other rare
things also, which no man would beleeve unlesse he had
seene them with his owne eyes.</p>

<h3><i>Of the citie of Cambaleth.</i><a name="page246a" id="page246a"></a></h3>
</div>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>RAVELING eight dayes journey further by divers
territories and cities, at length I came by fresh
water unto a certaine citie named Leucyn, standing upon
a river of Karavoran<a id="footnotetag11a1" name="footnotetag11a1"></a><a href="#footnote11a1"><sup>1</sup></a> which runneth through the midst
of Cataie, and doeth great harme in the countrey when
it overfloweth the bankes, or breaketh foorth of the
chanell. From thence passing along the river Eastward,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id="page247"></a>[pg 247]</span>
after many dayes travell, and the sight of divers cities, I
arrived at a citie called Sumakoto,<a id="footnotetag11a2" name="footnotetag11a2"></a><a href="#footnote11a2"><sup>2</sup></a> which aboundeth
more with silke then any other citie in the worlde: for
when there is a great scarcity of silke, fortie pound is
solde for lesse then eight groates. In this citie there is
abundance of all merchandize, and all kinds of victuals
also, as of bread, wine, flesh, fish, with all choise and
delicate spices. Then travelling on still towards the East
by many cities, I came unto the noble and renowned
citie of Cambaleth, which is of great antiquitie, being
situate in the province of Cataie. This citie the Tartars
tooke, &amp; neere unto it within the space of halfe a mile,
they built another citie called Caido. The citie of
Caido hath twelve gates, being each of them two miles
distant from another. Also the space lying in the midst
betweene the two foresayde cities is very well and
thoroughly inhabited, so that they make as it were but one
citie betweene them both. The whole compasse or circuit
of both cities together is 40 miles. In this citie the
great emperour Can hath his principall seat, and his
Imperiall palace, the wals of which palace containe foure
miles in circuit: and neere unto this his palace are many
other palaces and houses of his nobility which belong
unto his court. Within the precincts of the said palace
Imperiall, there is a most beautifull mount, set and replenished
with trees, for which cause it is called the
Greene mount, having a most royall and sumptuous
palace standing thereupon, in which, for the most part,
the great Can is resident. Upon the one side of the
sayde mount there is a great lake, whereupon a most
stately bridge is built, in which lake a great abundance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page248" id="page248"></a>[pg 248]</span>
of geese, ducks, &amp; all kinds of water foules, and in the
wood growing upon the mount, there is a great store of
all birdes and wilde beastes. And therefore when the
great Can will solace himselfe with hunting or hauking,
he needs not so much as once to step forth of his palace.
Moreover, the principall palace, wherein he maketh his
abode, is very large, having within it 14 pillers of golde,
and all the walles thereof are hanged with red skinnes,
which are said to be the most costly skinnes in all the
world. In the midst of the palace stands a cisterne of
two yards high, which consisteth of a precious stone
called Merdochas, and is wreathed about with golde, &amp;
at ech corner thereof is the golden image of a serpent, as
it were furiously shaking and casting forth his head.
This cisterne also hath a kinde of network of pearle
wrought about it. Likewise by the sayd cisterne there
is drinke conveyed thorow certaine pipes and conducts
such as useth to be drunke in the emperours court, upon
the which also there hang many vessels of golde, wherein
whosoever will may drinke of the said licour. In the
foresayd palace there are many peacockes of golde: &amp;
when any Tartar maketh a banquet unto his lorde, if
the guests chance to clap their hands for joy and mirth
the said golden peacocks also will spread their wings
abroad, and lift up their traines, seeming as if they
danced, and this I suppose to be done by arte magicke
or by some secret engine under the grounde.</p>

<h3><i>Of the glory and magnificence of the great Can.</i></h3>
</div>
<p><span class="dropcap">M</span>OREOVER, when the great emperour Can sitteth
on his imperiall throne of estate, on his lefte
hand sitteth his queene or empresse and upon another
inferior seate there sit two other women, which are to
accompany the emperour, when his spouse is absent, but
in the lowest place of all, there sit all the ladies of his
kinred. <i>All the married women weare upon their heads a
kind of ornament in shape like unto a man's foote of a
cubite and a halfe in length, and the lower part of the said
foote is adorned with cranes feathers</i>, and is all ouer thicke
set with great and orient pearles. Upon the right hande
of the great Can sitteth his first begotten sonne and heire
apparent unto his empire, and under him sit all the
nobles of the blood royall. There bee also foure Secretaries,
which put all things in writing that the emperour
speaketh. In whose presence likewise stand his Barons
and divers others of his nobilitie, with great traines of
folowers after them, of whom none dare speake so much
as one worde, unlesse they haue obtained licence of the
emperour so to doe, except his jesters and stage players,
who are appointed of purpose to solace their lord.
Neither yet dare they attempt to doe ought, but onely
according to the pleasure of their emperor, and as hee
enjoineth by lawe. About the palace gate stand certaine
Barons to keepe all men from treading upon the threshold
of the sayd gate. When it pleaseth the great Can
to solemnize a feast, he hath about him 14000 Barons,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id="page250"></a>[pg 250]</span>
carying wreathes &amp; litle crownes upon their heads, and
giving attendance upon their lord, and eueryone of them
weareth a garment of golde and precious stones, which
is worth ten thousand florens. His court is kept in very
good order, by governours of tens, governours of hundreds,
and governours of thousands, insomuch that euery
one in his place performeth his dutie committed to him,
neither is there any defect to bee found. I Frier
Odoricus was there present in person for the space of
three yeares and was often at the sayd banquets: for
wee friers Minorites have a place of aboad appointed
out for us in the emperours court, and are enjoined to
goe and to bestow our blessing upon him. And I enquired
of certain courtiers concerning the number of
persons pertaining to the emperors court. Moreouer,
when he will make his progresse from one countrey to
another, hee hath foure troupes of horsemen, one being
appointed to goe a dayes journey before, and another to
come a dayes journey after him, the third to march on
his right hand and the fourth on his left, in the maner
of a crosse, he himselfe being in the midst, and so euery
particular troupe haue their daily journeys limited unto
them, to the ende they may provide sufficient victuals
without defect. Nowe the great Can himselfe is caried
in maner following: hee rideth in a chariot with two
wheeles, upon which a majesticall throne is built of the
wood of Aloe, being adorned with gold and great pearles
and precious stones, and foure elephants bravely furnished
doe drawe the sayd chariot, before which elephants
foure greate horses richly trapped and covered
doe lead the way. Hard by the chariot on both sides
thereof, are foure Barons laying hold and attending
thereupon, to keepe all persons from approching neere
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id="page251"></a>[pg 251]</span>
unto their emperour. Upon the chariot two milke-white
jer-falcons doe sit, and seeing any game which hee would
take, hee letteth them fly, and so they take it, and after
this maner doeth hee solace himselfe as hee rideth.
Moreover, no man dare come within a stone's cast of the
chariot, but such as are appointed. The number of his
owne followers, of his wives attendants, and of the traine
of his first begotten sonne and heire apparent, would
seem incredible to any man; unless he had first seene it
with his owne eyes. The foresayd great Can hath
divided his Empire into twelue parts or provinces, and
one of the said provinces hath two thousand great cities
within the precincts thereof. Whereupon his empire is
of that length and breadth, that unto whatsoever part
thereof he intendeth his journey, he hath space enough
for six moneths continual progress, except his islands
which are at the least 5000.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h3><i>Of certaine Innes or hospitals appointed for traveilers

</div>
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE foresayd Emperor (to the end that travailers
may haue all things necessary throughout his
whole empire) hath caused certaine Innes to be provided
in sundry places upon the highwayes, where all things
pertaining unto victuals are in a continuall readinesse.
And when any alteration or newes happen in any part
of his Empire, if he chance to be farre absent from that
part, his ambassadors upon horses or dromedaries ride
post unto him, and when themselves and their beaste are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>[pg 252]</span>
weary, they blowe their horne, at the noise whereof, the
next Inne likewise provideth a horse and a man, who
takes the letter from him that is weary, and runneth
unto another Inne: and so by divers Innes, and divers
postes, the report, which ordinarily could skarce come
in 30 dayes, is in one naturall day brought unto the
Emperour: and therefore no matter of any moment can
be done in his empire, but straightway he hath intelligence
of it. Moreouer when the great Can himselfe will
go on hunting, he useth this custome. Some 20 days
journey from the citie of Kambaleth there is a forrest
containing six dayes journey in circuit, in which forrest
there are so many kinds of beasts and birds as it is incredible
to report. Unto this forrest, at the ende of
euery thirde or fourthe yeere, himself with his whole
traine resorteth, and they all of them together environ
the said forrest, sending dogs into the same, which by
hunting doe bring foorth the beasts: namely lions and
stags, and other creatures, unto a most beautifull plaine
in the midst of the forrest, because all the beasts of the
forrest doe tremble, especially at the cry of hounds.
Then cometh the great Can himselfe, being caried upon
three elephants, and shooteth fiue arrowes into the whole
herd of beasts, and after him all his Barons, and after
them the rest of his courtiers and family doe all in like
maner discharge their arrowes also, and euery mans
arrow hath a sundry marke. Then they all goe unto the
beasts which are slaine (suffering the living beasts to
returne into the wood that they may haue more sport
with them another time) and euery man enjoyeth that
beast as his owne, wherein he findeth his arrow sticking.</p>

<h3><i>Of the foure feasts which the great Can solemnizeth euery
yeere in his court.</i></h3>
</div>
<p><span class="dropcap">F</span>OURE great feasts in a yeere doeth the emperor
Can celebrate: namely the feast of his birth, the
feast of his circumcision, the feast of his coronation, and
the feast of his mariage. And unto these feasts he inviteth
all his Barons, his stage players, and all such as
are of his kinred. Then the great Can sitting in his
throne, all his Barons present themselves before him,
with wreaths and crowns upon their heads, being diversely
attired, for some of them are in greene, namely the principall:
the seconde are in red, and the third in yellow:
and they hold each man in his hand a little Ivorie table
of elephants tooth, and they are girt with golden girdles
of halfe a foote broad, and they stand upon their feete
keeping silence. About them stand the stage-players
or musicians with their instruments. And in one of the
corners of a certaine great pallace, all the Philosophers
or Magicians remaine for certaine howers, and do attend
upon points or characters; and when the point and
hower which the sayd Philosophers expected for, is
come, a certain crier crieth out with a loud voice, saying,
Incline or bowe your selves before your Emperour; with
that all the Barons fall flat upon the earth. Then hee
crieth oute againe: Arise all, and immediately they all
arise. Likewise the Philosophers attend upon a point
or character the second time, and when it is fulfilled the
crier crieth out amaine: Put your fingers in your eares;
and foorthwith againe he saieth: Plucke them out.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page254" id="page254"></a>[pg 254]</span>
Againe, at the third point he crieth, Boult this meale.
Many other circumstances also doe they performe, all
which they say haue some certaine signification, howbeit
neither would I write them, nor giue any heed unto
them, because they are vaine and ridiculouse. And
when the musicians houre is come, then the Philosophers
say, Solemnize a feast unto your Lord: with that all of
them sound their instruments, making a great and
melodious noise. And immediately another crieth,
Peace, Peace, and they are all whist. Then come the
women-musicians, and sing sweetly before the Emperour,
which musike was more delightfull unto me. After them
come in the lions and doe their obeisance unto the great
Can. Then the juglers cause golden cups full of wine
to flie up and downe in the ayre &amp; to apply themselves
unto mens mouths that they may drinke of them. These
any many other strange things I sawe in the court of
the great Can, which no man would beleeve unlesse he
had seen them with his owne eies, and therefore I omit
to speake of them. I was informed also by certaine credible
persons of another miraculous thing, namely, that
in a certaine Kingdome of the sayd Can, wherein stand
the mountains called Kapsei (the Kingdomes name is
Kalor) there <i>groweth great Gourds or Pompions,</i><a id="footnotetag14a1" name="footnotetag14a1"></a><a href="#footnote14a1"><sup>1</sup></a> <i>which

which at a certaine time of the yeere doe fall into the water,

West. And at length I came unto the empire of Pretegoani,<a id="footnotetag15a1" name="footnotetag15a1"></a><a href="#footnote15a1"><sup>1</sup></a>
whose principall citie is Kasan, which hath many
cities under it. From thence passing many dayes travel
I came unto a province called Casan, which is for good
commodities, one of the onely provinces under the Sunne,
&amp; is very well inhabited, insomuch that when we depart
out of the gates of one city we may beholde the gates of
another city, as I myselfe sawe in divers of them. The
breadth of the said province is 50 dayes journey and the
length aboue sixtie. In it there is great plenty of all
victuals, and especially of chesnuts, and it is one of the
twelve provinces of the great Can. Going on further, I
came unto a certaine Kingdome called Tebek,<a id="footnotetag15a2" name="footnotetag15a2"></a><a href="#footnote15a2"><sup>2</sup></a> which is
in subjection unto the great Can also, wherein I thinke
there is more plenty of bread and wine then in any other
part of the worlde besides. The people of the sayd
countrey do, for the most part, inhabit in tents made of
blacke felt. Their principall city is invironed with faire
and beautifull walls, being built of most white and blacke
stones, which are disposed checkerwise one by another,
and curiously compiled together: likewise all the high
wayes in this countrey are exceedingly well paved. In
the said countrey none dare shed the bloud of a man, or
of any beast, for the reverence of a certaine idol. In the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id="page256"></a>[pg 256]</span>
aforesayd citie their Abassi, that is to say, their Pope is
resident, being the head and prince of all idolaters (upon
whom he bestoweth and distributeth gifts after his maner)
euen as our Pope of Rome accounts himselfe to be the
head of all Christians. The Women of this countrey
weare aboue an hundreth tricks &amp; trifles about them,
and they haue two teeth in their mouthes as long as the
tuskes of a boare. <i>When any mans father deceaseth
among them, his sonne assembleth together all the priests
and musicians that he can get, saying that he is determined
to honour his father: then causeth he him to be caried into
the field (all his kinsfolks, friends, and neighbours, accompanying
him in the sayd action) where the priests with
great solemnity cut off the fathers head, giving it unto his
sonne, which being done, they divide the whole body into
morsels, and so leaue it behinde them, returning home with
prayers in the company of the said sonne. So soone as
they are departed, certain vultures, which are accustomed
to such bankets, come flying from the mountains, and cary
away all the sayd morsels of flesh: and from thenceforth
a fame is spread abroad, that the sayd party deceased was
holy, because the angels of God carried him into paradise.
And this is the greatest and highest honour, that the sonne
can devise to performe unto his father. Then the sayd
sonne taketh his fathers head, seething it and eating the
flesh thereof, but of the skull he maketh a drinking cup,
wherein himselfe with all his family and kinred do drinke
with great solemnitie and mirth, in the remembrance of his
dead and devoured father.</i> Many other vile and abominable
things doth the sayd nation commit, which I
meane not to write because men neither can nor will

<h3><i>Of a certaine riche man, who is fed and nourished by 50 virgins</i>.</h3>
</div>
<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>HILE I was in the province of Mancy, I passed
by the palace of a certaine famous man, which
hath fifty virgin damosels continually attending upon
him, feeding him euery meale as a bird feeds her yoong
ones. Also he hath sundry kinds of meat served in at
his table and three dishes of ech kinde: and when the
said virgins feed him, they singe most sweetly. This
man hath in yeerely revenues thirty thuman of tagars of
rise, euery of which thuman yeeldeth tenne thousand
tagars, and one tagar is the burthen of an asse. His
palace is two miles in circuit, the pavement thereof is
one plate of golde and another of silver. Neere unto the
wall of the sayd palace there is a mount artificially
wrought with golde and silver, whereupon stand turrets
and steeples, and other delectable things for the solace
and recreation of the foresayd great man. And it was
tolde me that there were foure such men in the sayd
kingdome. It is accounted a great grace for the men of
that countrey to haue long nailes upon their fingers, and
especially upon their thumbes which nailes they may
folde about their handes: but the grace and beauty of
their women is to haue small and slender feet: and
therefore the mothers when their daughters are yoong,
do binde up their feete that they may not grow great.
Travelling on further towards the South, I arrived at a
certain countrey called Melistorte, which is a pleasant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page258" id="page258"></a>[pg 258]</span>
and fertile place. In this countrey was a certain aged
man called Senex de monte, who round about two
mountaines had built a wall to inclose the said mountaines.
Within this wall there were the fairest and most
chrystall fountaines in the whole world: and about the
sayd fountaines there were the most beautifull virgins in
great number, and goodly horses also, and in a word,
euery thing that could be devised for bodily solace and
delight, and therefore the inhabitants of the countrey
call the same place by the name of Paradise. The olde
Senex, when he saw any proper and valiant yoong man,
he would admit him into his paradise. Moreover by
certain conducts he makes wine and milke to flow abundantly.
This Senex when he hath a minde to revenge
himselfe or to slay any king or baron, commandeth him
who is governor of the sayd paradise, to bring thereunto
some of the acquaintance of the sayd king or baron,
permitting him a while to take his pleasure therein, and
then to give him a certaine potion being of force, to cast
him into such a slumber as should make him quite voide
of all sense, and so being in a profound sleepe to convey
him out of his paradise: who being awakened and seeing
himselfe thrust out of the paradise, would become so
sorrowfull, that he could not in the world devise what to
do, or whither to turne him. Then would he goe unto
the foresaid old man, beseeching him that he might be
admitted again into his paradise, who saith unto him,
You cannot be admitted thither, unlesse you will slay
such or such a man for my sake, &amp; if you will giue the
attempt onely, whether you kill him or no, I will place
you againe in paradise, that there you may remain
always: then would the party without faile put the same
in execution, indevouring to murther all those against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page259" id="page259"></a>[pg 259]</span>
whom the old man had conceived any hatred. And
therefore all the kings of the east stood in awe of the
sayd olde man, and gaue unto him great tribute.</p>

and ignominious death. The friers in that place haue
this special gift and prerogative, namely, that by the
vertue of the name of Christ Jesu, &amp; in the vertue of his
precious blood, which he shedde upon the crosse for the
salvation of mankinde, they doe cast foorth devils out of
them that are possessed. And because there are many
possessed men in those parts, they are bound and brought
ten dayes journey unto the sayd friers, who being dispossessed
of the uncleane spirits, do presently beleeve in
Christ, who delivered them, accounting him for their
God, and being baptised in his name, and also delivering
immediately unto the friers all their idols and the idols
of their cattell, which are commonly made of felt or of
womens haire: then the sayd friers kindle a fire in a
publicke place (whereunto the people resort, that they
may see the false gods of their neighbors burnt), and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page260" id="page260"></a>[pg 260]</span>
cast the sayd idols thereinto: howbeit at first those idols
came out of the fire againe. Then the friers sprinkled
the sayd fire with holy water, casting in the idols the
second time, and with that the devils fled in the likenesse
of black smoake, and the idols still remained till
they were consumed unto ashes. Afterward, this noise
and outcry was heard in the ayre: Beholde and see how
I am expelled out of my habitation. And by these
means the friers doe baptise great multitudes, who presently
revolt againe unto their idols; insomuch that the
sayd friers must eftsoones, as it were, underprop them,
and informe them anew. <i>There was another terrible
thing which I saw there: for passing by a certaine valley,
which is situate beside a pleasant river, I saw many dead
bodies, and in the said valley also I heard divers sweet
sounds and harmonies of musike, especially the noise of
citherns, whereat I was greatly amazed. This valley conteineth
in length seven or eight miles at the least, into the
which whosoeuer entreth, dieth presently, and can by no
means passe aliue thorow the middest thereof; for which
cause all the inhabitants thereabout decline unto the one
side. Moreover, I was tempted to go in &amp; to see what it
was. At length, making my prayers and recommending
my selfe to God in the name of Jesu, I entred, and saw
such swarmes of dead bodies there, as no man would
beleeve unless he were an eyewitnesse thereof. At the one
side of the foresayde valley upon a certaine stone, I saw
the visage of a man, which behelde me with such a terrible
aspect that I thought verily I should haue died in the same
place. But alwayes this sentence, the word became flesh,
and dwelt amomgst us, I ceased not to pronounce, signing
my selfe with the signe of the crosse, and neerer than seven
to eight pases I durst not approach unto the sayd head:</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page261" id="page261"></a>[pg 261]</span>
<i>but I departed &amp; fled unto another place in the sayd valley</i>,
ascending up into a little sande mountaine, where looking
about, I saw nothing but the sayd citherns, which
methought I heard miraculously sounding and playing
by themselves without the helpe of musicians. And
being upon the toppe of the mountaine, I found silver
there like the scales of fishes in great abundance, and I
gathered some part thereof into my bosome to shew for
a wonder, but my conscience rebuking me, I cast it upon
the earth, reserving no whit at all unto my selfe, and so,
by God's grace I departed without danger. And when
the men of the countrey knew that I was returned out
of the valley alive, they reverenced me much, saying
that I was baptised and holy, and that the foresayd
bodies were men subject unto the devils infernall who
used to play upon citherns, to the end they might allure
people to enter, and so murther them. Thus much concerning
these things which I beheld most certainly with
mine eyes, I frier Odoricus haue heere written: many
strange things also I haue of purpose omitted, because
men will not beleeue them unlesse they should see them.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span> &nbsp;WILL report one thing more, which I saw, concerning
the great Can. It is an usuall custome in those
parts, that when the foresayd Can traveileth thorow any
countrey, his subjects kindle fires before their doores,
casting spices thereinto to make a perfume, that their
lord passing by may smell the sweet and delectable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page262" id="page262"></a>[pg 262]</span>
odours thereof, and much people come forth to meet
him. And upon a certaine time when he was comming
towardes Cambaleth, the fame of his approch being
published, a bishop of ours with certaine of our minorite
friers and myselfe went two dayes journey to meet him:
and being come nigh unto him, we put a crosse upon
wood. I my selfe having a censer in my hand, and
began to sing with a loud voice: Veni creator spiritus.
And as we were singing on this wise he caused us to be
called, commanding us to come unto him: notwithstanding
(as it is above mentioned) that no man dare
approche within a stones cast of his chariot, unlesse he
be called, but such onely as keep his chariot. And when
we came neare unto him, he vailed his hat or bonet
being of an inestimable price, doing reverence unto the
crosse. And immediately I put incense into the censour,
and our bishop taking the censer perfumed him,
and gaue him his benediction. Moreouer, they that
come before the said Can, do alwayes bring some oblation
to present unto him, observing the ancient law:
Thou shalt not appear in my presence with an empty
hand. And for that cause we carried apples with us,
and offered them in a platter with reverence unto him:
and taking out two of them he did eate some part of
one. And then he signified unto us, that we should go
apart, lest the horses comming on might in ought offend
us. With that we departed from him, and turned aside,
going unto certaine of his barons, which had been converted
to the faith by certaine friers of our order, being
at the same time in his army: and we offered unto them
of the foresayd apples, who received them at our hands
with great joy, seeming unto us to be as glad, as if we
had giuen them some great gift. All the premisses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page263" id="page263"></a>[pg 263]</span>
above written frier William de Solanga hath put downe
in writing euen as the foresayd frier Odoricus uttered
them by word of mouth, in the yeere of our Lord 1330
in the moneth of May, and in the place of S. Anthony
of Padua. <i>Neither did he regard to write them in difficult
Latine, or in an eloquent style, but even as Odoricus himselfe
rehearsed them, to the end that men might the more
easily understand the things reported.</i> I Odoricus frier,
of Friuli, of a certaine territory called Portus Vahonis,
and of the order of the minorites, do testifie and beare
witnesse unto the reverend father Guidotus minister of
the province of S. Anthony, in the marquisate of Treviso
(being by him required upon mine obedience so to
doe) that all the premisses above written, either I saw
with mine owne eyes, or heard the same reported by
credible and substantiall persons. The common report
also of the countreys where I was, testifieth those things,
which I saw, to be true. Many other things I haue
omitted because I behelde them not with my owne eyes.
Howbeit from day to day I purpose with my selfe to
travell countreys or lands, in which action I dispose myselfe
to die or to live, as it shall please my God.</p>

<h3><i>Of the death of frier Odoricus.</i><a name="page263a" id="page263a"></a></h3>
</div>
<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N the yeere therefore of our Lord 1331 the foresayd
frier Odoricus preparing himselfe for the performance
of his intended journey, that his travel and labour
might be to greater purpose, he determined to present
himselfe unto Pope John the two and twentieth, whose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page264" id="page264"></a>[pg 264]</span>
benediction and obedience being received, he with a
certaine number of friers willing to beare him company
might convey himselfe unto all the countreys of infidels.
And as he was travelling toward the pope, and not farre
distant from the city of Pisa, there meets him by the
waye a certaine olde man, in the habit and attire of a
pilgrime, saluting him by name and saying: All haile
frier Odoricus. And when the frier demaunded how he
had knowledge of him: he answered: Whilest you were
in India I knew you full well, yea, and I knew your holy
purpose also: but see that you returne immediately unto
the coven<a id="footnotetag19a1" name="footnotetag19a1"></a><a href="#footnote19a1"><sup>1</sup></a> from where you came, for tenne dayes hence
you shall depart out of this present world. Wherefore
being astonished and amazed at these words, (especially
the olde man vanishing out of his sight, presently after
he had spoken them) he determined to returne. And so
he returned in perfect health feeling no crazedness nor
infirmity of body. And being in his coven at Udene
in the province of Padua, the tenth daye after the foresayd
vision, having received the Communion, and preparing
himselfe unto God, yea, being strong and sound
of body, hee happily rested in the Lord: who sacred
departure was signified unto the Pope aforesaid, under
the hand of the publique notary in these words following.</p>

<p>In the yeere of our Lord 1331, the 14 day of Januarie,
Beatus Odoricus a Frier minorite deceased in Christ, at
whose prayers God shewed many and sundry miracles,

<h4>Transcriber's Note<a name="transcriber_note"></a></h4>

  <p>The spelling of this book is from the 14th Century, is often
  phonetic, and is not necessarily consistent.</p>

  <p>e.g., 'hear' (auditory) is also spelt 'here' and 'heare';<br />
  'here' (location) is also spelt 'heere', 'heare';<br />
  'here' has also been used to spell 'hair';<br />
  'were' is sometimes used for 'where';<br />
  'Jhon' is 'John', etc.</p>

  <p>'y<sup>t</sup>' usually means 'that', and 'y<sup>e</sup>' is 'the'.</p>

  <p>'to' is used for 'to' and 'too';<br />
  'by' for 'by' and 'buy';<br />
  'of' for 'of' and 'off';<br />
  and 'off' for 'off' and 'of'....</p>

  <p>'li' = libre = a pound (both weight and money, depending on
  context);<br />
  a groat = 4 pence; a florin = 2 shillings.</p>

  <p>A word or name can be spelt several ways in the same paragraph,
  and names capitalised and non-capitalised in the same sentence.</p>

  <p> Apostrophes (of ownership) were sometimes present, sometimes
  absent, even in the same paragraph.</p>

  <p>Also, (e.g.):</p>

  <p>'le IIII iour dauril' = 'le IIII jour d'avril' = the 4th day of April;<br />
  'natif dangleterre' = 'natif d'angleterre' = 'native of England', etc.</p>

  <p>"And ye shall understande that Lothe was Arons sone, Abraham's
  brother, and Sara Abraham's wyfe was Loths syster, and Sara was
  xc yere olde when she gate Ysaac and Abraham had another son named
  Ismael that he had gotten on his mayden Ager."</p>

  <p>14th century spellings have not been modernised. 'u' was often,
  but not always, printed for 'v'</p>

  <p>Modern spelling rules did not apply until later in the reign of
  Queen Victoria (19th century).</p>

  <p>Many strange spellings of personal and place names have been
  explained by the author in the Footnotes.</p>

  <p>This book has many Footnotes, and the Footnotes have been placed
  at the ends of their relevant Chapters.</p>

  <p>Some missing or damaged punctuation has been repaired, though
  punctuation was not always present. </p>

  <p>Some missing Greek diacritics have been added, and some Greek and Latin typos corrected.</p>

  <p>Some illustrations which interrupted paragraphs have been moved to
  more appropriate places. There are also some small 'glyphs' or
  small drawings at the ends of some chapters, which have been
  placed after the footnotes for the relevant chapters, thus
  following the layout of the book.</p>

  <p>Some illustrations have been re-used. One illustration has been
  used multiple times. This was common practice with Chap Book
  woodcuts, which would have been hand-carved.</p>

  <p>Page xv: The inscription has a character which looks like a reversed
  capital C, but which is actually a ROMAN NUMERAL REVERSED ONE HUNDRED <span style="font-size: 1.05em">&#8579;</span> (U+2183). </p>

  <p>The date of the inscription is given as CI<span style="font-size: 1.05em">&#8579;</span>CCLXXXI.<br /> i.e. hundreds, ten, (1000) plus 200
  plus 81, or the year 1281.</p>

  <p>Page 2: catell<sup>5</sup> = chattel ('goods and chattels').</p>

  <p>Pages 5-6: Footnotes #5 and #9 each have 1 answer for 2 queries.</p>

  <p>Page 42: 'Araham's' corrected to 'Abraham's'.</p>

  <p class="ind">"And two myle from Ebron is the grave of Loth<sup>6</sup> that was Abraham's
  brother." (F. 6: Lot.)</p>

  <p>Page 47: 'is' corrected to 'it'.</p>

  <p class="ind">"... and that it was forbidden in the olde lawe."</p>

  <p>Page 53. "... and thereby are three<sup>15</sup> other pyllers...."</p>

  <p class="ind">Footnote 15: [Other editions say four, which is the number represented in the
  engraving.] So this edition would appear to be correct, as one
  pillar, plus three other pillars = four pillars.</p>

  <p>Page 54: 'me' corrected to (second) 'men'. (original printer error?
  or original author's careless style?)</p>

  <p class="ind">"... as these landes are lost through sinne of Christen men, so
  shall they be won againe by christen men throygh the helpe of God."</p>

  <p>Page 58: "... they encline<sup>1</sup> thereto &amp; and then they take it, and
  laye it upon their heads, and afterward...."</p>
  <p>Either '&amp;' or 'and' is extraneous. For consistency, transcriber removed '&amp;'.</p>

  <p>Page 84: Footnote #4 has 1 answer for 2 queries.</p>

  <p>Page 91, Footnote 7: 'Khalif Molawakkel' corrected to Khalif Motawakkel (i.e. Al-Mutawakkil) ...<br />

  <p>Page 94: "... or else at Lamaton, And then enter shyppe againe,..."
  is as printed, and it does make sense, in the context.</p>

  <p>Page 110, Footnote 5: There are two Footnotes #5 and one Footnote
  reference #5, all matching original, but they <i>are</i> connected.</p>

  <p>Page 120, Footnote 1: 'Monscoli' corrected to 'Monocoli'</p>

  <p class="ind">"For instance, in Book 7, chap, li., devoted to
  Man, he (Plini) quotes Ctesias as saying that in India is another race of

Scope: Approximately 16,000 works (in 20,240 volumes) collected by the statesman
and British Museum Trustee Thomas Grenville. The collection contains printed books
from the 15th to 19th centuries, and complements the King's Library in terms of
incunabula and post-incunabula, early voyages, bibles, vernacular poetry and
romances (especially Italian and Spanish), and English literature. The collection
is particularly noted for its fine bindings. Bequeathed to the Museum in 1846.
Although part of the Grenville Library, the volumes at G.20276-78 were absent
from the collection when it arrived at the British Museum. They were subsequently
acquired though the book trade by either the British Museum or the British Library.</p>

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
